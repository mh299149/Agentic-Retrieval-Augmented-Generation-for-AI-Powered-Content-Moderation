If youre going to operate outside the channels ... do the whole renegade cop thing ... you might want to make sure that you get the right guy .
Chief , we almost had the guy .
Our intelligence was just a little off .
Wait a minute .
Intelligence ?
Look around you , Copeland .

I cant believe you have me sitting here all night worried about you .
All night ?
Baby ... its only 8 : 00 .
Look , after work , me and Kevin went down to the bar and had a couple of drinks .
I know .
I called the bar .
They said you left at 7 : 45 .
I checked MapQuest .
It only takes six minutes to get there from here .
So , if you got somebody on the side , you need to tell me .
Baby , listen to what you just say .
MapQuest said it takes six minutes to get here .
I got here in eight .
Which means theres two minutes unaccounted for .
If I was cheating on you , dont you think Id need more than two minutes ?
You know what ?
I aint going to deal with this .
Im tired , okay ?
I had a long day at work .
I got shot at .
See , that is exactly what lm talking about .
We dont communicate .
- Okay , fine .
You want to communicate ?
- Yes .
Come on .
Lets communicate .
Okay ?
Okay .
Lets start with last week .
Last week .
You and I were supposed to go shopping together .
We get to the mall .
I buy this beautiful dress , I get my hair done .
You dont say anything .
I dont know , maybe you just dont want to ...
Did you hear me just now ?
Tell me what I said .
I heard everything .
You was communicating .
Dont play with me right now .
I am not in the mood .
I cannot believe you came home late and then you start ...
Marcus !
You are falling asleep again .
I am talking to you .
I wasnt asleep , I was closing my eyes and visualizing your words .
Oh , really ?
Visualizing ?
Why dont you paint me a picture of what I just said ?
- Hold on .
- You know why ?
Because you are falling asleep again .
Marcus !
We received this from Mr. Andrew Wilson , CEO of Wilson Cruise Lines .
It was delivered to his home .
The girls in the photo are his daughters ... and heiresses to the Wilson fortune .
We believe they are the kidnappers next victims .
Mr. Wilson has given us permission to shadow his daughters .
Were going to set up surveillance ... and if the kidnapper strikes ... this time we will be ready .
Now , the Wilson sisters will be flying into JFK this morning .
So whos going to pick them up ?
Obviously , everyone has read the profile on the girls .
Still , somebodys got to do it .
I dont think this is a good idea .
I dont care .
We deserve to be on this case just as much as Gomez and Harper .
I know , but we dont want to interrupt the man in a briefing .
Well , somebody got to stand up to him .
- Chief .
- What ?
- Marcus has something he want to tell you .
- What ?
Chief , we just want to know if we could get on the case .
Youre on .
The boys over at Intel seem to think that the kidnappers a guy ... named Ted Burton .
It says Burton was a partner of Wilsons ... and some other associates in some business venture that failed .
Says he spent time in the Federal pen and lost his fortune .
Guys been MlA since his release and those dates coincide with the first kidnappings .
- What do you think ?
- I think this babysitting gig sucks .
Dude , relax .
Look , man .
All we got to do is pick these chicks up ... drop their ass off in the Hamptons , then we back in the Chiefs good graces .
I didnt join the FBI to become a nanny .
I want to be on the street where the action is .
Okay , Blackie Chan , and youll get there .
Can we just do this first , please ?
- All right .
- You didnt put dairy in this , did you ?
- No .
- Because you know lm lactose intolerant .
Last time , I barely made it to the bathroom .
Why would I want to disturb your stomach ?
There goes your girls .
Come on , man .
Lets do this .
- Hi , lm Kevin Copeland .
This is ...
- We already gave to the United Negro Fund .
- Wait .
Hold on .

Put makeup on this ?
I am so fricking pissed .
My God , this is like the worst day of my life .
I went to go get my brows done ... and I told her to make me look like J- Lo .
And then that fricking Russian toad made me look ...

Oh , my God !

You know how it is when you really care about someone .
You call them all day long ... because you just wanna know how their day is going ... and what theyre thinking about and if theyre thinking about you .
You spend all day trying to find the perfect outfit .
You even change your hairstyle just so hell take a second look .
But they never notice .
Sometimes I just wish that they could trade places with us ... so that they would know how it feels .

You cannot stay .
There are laws against this kind of workmanship .

I dont want to go on a date with a guy and his dog is biting him and ...
Whats he doing now ?
Whats that ?
Dont pay him no mind .
Hes just going to do that until he falls asleep .
Now , where were we ?
Wine !
You know , I like a woman with a little extra something .
A little cushion for the pushing .
Id really love for you to come to one of my games .
No , thank you .
Ive seen you play .
Not impressed .
Excuse me ?
Lm the highest scoring forward in the league !
But all that talent ?
Totally overshadowed by nothing but scandals and pure laziness .
Come on !
Youre shooting under 50 %% from the free throw line , okay ?
Your turnover ratio , abysmal .
And on top of that , you cant shoot three- pointers to save your life .
So ... squeeze me .
No ones ever cared like that before .
Come here , baby !
Oopsie !
I had a poopsie .
Girl , were going to get along just fine .
Back at you !

So , no .
I jump over the fence , fall .
I scrape my knee .
- Get out of here .
- No , seriously , listen .
I scrape my knee .
I get chased by the cops and I spend the night in jail .
Thats insane .
You did all that just to find J- Lo and Bens hideaway ?
I cant help it .
You know , investigative journalism is my passion .
So howd you end up writing puff pieces for the local news ?
Unfortunately , I made some enemies ... and ended up getting fired from my last job .
What happened ?
Believe me , you dont want to know about that .
Look , I spent all night talking about myself .
Sometimes its good for a man to just sit back and listen .
Well , since you put it that way .
I did this piece on Warren Vandergeld .
Him and his partners tried to swindle a guy .
You talking about Ted Burton ?
Yeah , how did you know that ?
It was in the paper .
I read about it .
But what they didnt report in the paper ... was that Burton was 10 times smarter than all of them .
He embezzled millions and stashed it in an offshore account .
When Vandergeld heard the story was going to break ... he didnt want to be embarrassed .
Well , there goes my job .
You know , youre a good listener .
It seems like you have the whole package .
Man !
- Hello ?
- Kev , you got to go .
- What ?
Now ?
- Yeah , now .
Were on our way .
Cant you stall him for a little while ?
Look , this man sang to me .
He tried to kiss me and on top of that ... he been farting for the last 20 minutes .
All right , ill be there in a minute .
Bye .
- Cottontail !
- Im coming , nigger !
Gomez , what the hell are we looking for ?
I dont know .
Something just isnt right about these girls .

Excuse me .
Thats for you , my little Miracle Whip .
You need to loosen up .
There you go .
Thats for you .
- Oh , my God !

Forget it , she just left .
Oops , she did it again .

To the last drop .

You know , thats a great idea .
Here , hold Baby .

Hold the dog .

Let it out .
Oh , yeah .
Now its out .
I paid thousands of dollars on this outfit ... and do you think he even noticed ?
Its going to be okay .
Little Miss Vandergeld walks in ... and he just forgets all about me .
Okay , let it out .
I wonder ... if he would think she was so hot ... if he knew that she is broke .
Vandergelds broke ?
We mustnt talk of such things .
No , we wont .
But , yes , theyre broke .
My father even had to loan her father money ... just so that they could keep their house .
They just paid us back .
- You guys , I love you guys .
- We love you , too .
I love you so much !
Thank you .
Can we get you some gum or a mint or something ?
Hey , little girl .

So dont tell me about we no more , all right ?
They bought it .

Would I let you down , Mr. V ?
- Hey , man .
I just want to say sorry .
- Forget about it , dude .
No .
Youre right .
Youre absolutely right .
Ive been selfish .
Im always dragging you into everything .
I never even asked what you want to do .
I dont know , theres something about always having you around , that just ... makes me want to step up my game .
I guess its because I always know youre gonna have my back .
Hello ?
