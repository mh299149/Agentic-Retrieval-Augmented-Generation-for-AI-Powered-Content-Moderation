I never said it wasn' t dangerous !
Do you see me right now ?

Have you thought about that ?
Don' t .

You know it' s worth to save people , isn' t it ?

- And if things do go wrong uncle Mike , all my friends in the firehouse , you know they never let anything happen to me .
Yeah .
Will you do me a favor ?

But he' s gonna be okay .
Can you do that for me ?

I was a hero , kids don' t forget things like this .
I don' t know , maybe it' il be best if I could not make it .
Don' t say that .
Don' t say that .
Hey Tommy , you are one of the best firemen in the country .

More for me to worry about or more for you to worry about , Jack ?
Linda , don' t tell me you don' t worry .
If you want to be honest , be honest .

You' ve been through a lot .
What can I say ?
You lost your best friend , gone through some bad fires .
Seen a lot of bodies hurt .
How' s the kids ?
That' s tough .
That' s tough .
See , now the problem is ,
I was married , my wife hated me being a firefighter , we got divorced nine months later .
You' re different , you are a good father , you worry .
But you should worry .
You know , maybe it' s time for a change of your scenery ?
I was thinking there' s a job down at headquarters , head position , do you like me to put your name in for ?
Are you saying I ain' t go to the firehouse ?
Well , I' m saying that you should ask yourself that question .
Maybe go home talk to Linda .
You know , be honest with yourself ?
Nothing wrong with moving on .
I did it .
So what did he say ?
Mike may have me transferred .
What does that mean for us ?
I' il be home nights .
70 cents an hour increase to pay .
Is that what you want ?
I don' t know .
It' s been so crazy lately .
You know , our kids are scared .
I see you upset and ... that' s terrible .
So this is about me and the kids again , is it ?
We' re married ten years , when you do this , it' s hard for me sometimes .
And I do get scared .
But I deal with it .
I' m proud of you .
You know , Mike asked me tonight , if I still love the job the way I did .
And the first time in my life .
I didn' t know what to say .
From midnight till the current hour , snow has been progressing into our area , and you can see just acids night hour , around see immediate , near metro area .

Do you hear me ?
Yeah , I hear you .
Promise to take care of my kids .
Tell them that I' il be always with them .
You tell them that , do you hear me ?
I will .
Command all units evacuate building immediately .
All units reporting clear , the building is clear , we' re all out .
Copy that .
It' s never an easy thing .
Saying good bye to a brother firefighter .
And this time is particularly difficult for me because I watched Jack growing to a one of the finest firefighters I' ve ever known .
He joined this department because he wanted to help people .
Who knows how many homes is still standing because Jack was there .
How many lives were spared .
He gave his life for that cause .
We' il never forget you , Jack .
And we are better for ever knowing you .
But I make you this one promise , tomorrow we will be back on the truck .
Because you was the bravest of the brave .
People are always asking me :
How is it that firefighters run to a burning building , when everyone else is running out ?
Jack , he would answer that question by saving another man' s life .
Your courage is the answer .
And today we will be as brave as you .
I' m not mourning you , I' m celebrating your life .
So I' d like everyone to stand up and celebrate the life of Jack Morrison .
