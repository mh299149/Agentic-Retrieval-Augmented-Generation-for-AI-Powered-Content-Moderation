- [if] Well , if Libby here likes us as much as we like her , we should just go ahead and move to adopt her baby girl .
Who' s the Father ?
Honestly , I don' t know .
Carlos and Gaby made a deal ...
I did remarry my ex , but it was only because he has great health insurance .
Susan made amends ... you know , I never thought I' d have such a good time hanging out with my girlfriend and her husband .
And Mike ... didn' t she mention we dated ?
Made a confession ... liar !
You' ve just been leading me on !
You' re obviously still in love with this guy !
Of his own .
On her first day of sobriety ,
Bree van de Kamp found an old cork , which reminded her just how much she craved Chablis .
So she called her sponsor , who came over with a DVD which they watched till her craving had passed .
Five days later , after she developed a thirst for Merlot ,
Peter arrived with a deck of cards .
The next week , he brought over chinese takeout because Bree had told him she was consumed by thoughts of vintage Chardonnay .
By her 20th day of sobriety , Bree had stopped thinking because her thoughts re now centered elsewhere .
Hmm ... yeah , huh .
I' m curious , Peter .
What is the easiest way to overcome addiction ?
Oh , some folks try shock therapy .
Other use , uh , hypnosis .
But taking it one day at a time still makes the most sense to me .
Why ?
I don' t know .
I guess I' m just impatient to get on with my life .
What are you doing ?
I was just giving you a little kiss .
Why ?
Well , it' s just my way of saying thank you for everything you' ve done for me over the past few weeks .
What' s ... wrong ?
This is gonna seem like it' s coming out of left field , but in addition to being a recovering alcoholic ,
I' m also a member of S. A.
Sex addicts anonymous .
Oh .
And that' s A ... a real thing ?
Yes .
Sex is as much an addiction for me as booze .
That' s why when you turn me on like that , it' s a bit of a problem .
It was just a peck on the cheek .
It doesn' t matter .
The slightest touch gets my juices flowing .
So ... how long has it been since you ... a year .
They have this rule ... plant , pet , person .
If I can keep a plant alive , you know , then I can move on to a pet .
And if I can make that work , then I can start dating again .
( chuckles ) so how are you doing ?
I' m on my fourth ficus .
Oh .
( chuckles ) see ?
I think you can handle affection better than you give yourself credit for .
Oh !
Oh !
Oh !
Oh , oh !
I' m sorry .
Um ...
I think I should go .
Really ?
Yeah .
Peter !
But ... but ... you forgot your shirt !
Keep it .
Though she didn' t know it ,
Bree had answered her own question .
The easiest way to overcome one addiction ... is to replace it with another .
Temptation ... it' s the name of a well- known establishment on the outskirts of fairview .
Its clientele is devoted .
Everyone who goes there wants to get their hands on something .
And when they cross a line ... hey !
I warned you , pal .
They are punished ... as a certain married couple were about to discover .
Hi .
You want a lap dance ?
Uh ... no , thanks .
No .
I sure hope Libby likes this camera .
Well , why wouldn' t she ?
It' s exactly what she asked for , the most expensive one in the store .
You know , I' m telling you , Carlos .
I' m getting really tired of kissing her ass .
The woman is giving us her baby .
We' il kiss whatever needs kissing .
What the hell are you guys doing here ?
Uh , we brought you this gift , and you said that you didn' t want us coming by your house ... thanks , but I' m working , so you gotta go .
Look , we spent a lot of money on that .
The least you can do is open it so we can bask in your happy expression .
Is there a problem here ?
No , we' re just talking .
It' s ... everything' s fine .
Carlos Solis .
This is my wife , Gabrielle .
We' re friends of Libby' s .
Oh , hey , I' m Frank , Libby' s boyfriend .
Libby , you didn' t tell us you had a boyfriend .
Didn' t I ?
I thought I had .
What' s that , a present for our baby ?
I' m sorry , did you just say " our " baby ?
Yeah .
It' s our first .
Hey !
What' s for lunch ?
Omelettes .
You want me to make you one ?
No , thank you .
I' il just pick at yours .
I didn' t know you still had a key , Dad .
Of course I do .
I have to watch out for my two favorite ladies .
Try the cheese .
That' s the best part .
Mmm .
You mean , two of your three favorite ladies .
You know , when you add in Edie .
Right !
Of course .
And speaking of Edie , I have some big news .
I finally did it .
I popped the question .
Oh !
Congratulations , Dad !
Yeah ... congratulations .
Um , what happened to waiting six months ?
( chuckling ) Edie and I aren' t getting married tomorrow .
It takes months to plan a classy wedding , you know ?
Remember ours , hmm ?
You had to have it outdoors , huh ?
Ugh .
It poured .
I could have murdered that weatherman .
We were all crammed under this little gazebo thing it was hysterical .
I thought the whole wedding day was ruined .
I loved it !
It felt spontaneous .
All our friends gathered close around us , hmm ?
Remember ?
You said it was the happiest day of your life .
Just like you marrying Edie will be the happiest day of her life .
Yeah .
Right .
Her , too .
Toodles .
Oh , hi .
Hello .
Andrew said it was all right for me to get a cream soda .
Uh , sure .
Help yourself .
There' s also frosted glasses in the freezer .
Can is fine , but thank you .
Oh , and , uh , I left a list for you of the witnesses we' il be deposing .
It' s , uh , there on the counter .
Hi .
Hey .
I know that you' re still angry with me , and , um ...
I wanted to tell you that I have , um ... joined a recovery program .
A. A.
I just wanted you to know that ... and to tell you I' m sorry .
You are ... a real friend , and I value your honesty .
Oh , I don' t wanna be mad anymore .
And I' m so happy to hear all that , and I am so proud of you .
Oh , thanks , but I' m not really out of the woods yet .
I still have this whole court case hanging over my head .
I heard about that .
Andrew' s asking to be emancipated ?
Yes , and his lawyer is taking depositions now to see if I am a fit parent .
Oy .
And considering that mishap that I had with your kids ,
I , uh , I imagine he' il be anxious to talk to you .
Well , it makes sense , I guess .
Yeah .
Do you have any idea what you might say ?
I , um ...
I' il focus on your good qualities .
I could not ask for anything more .
Thanks .
See you around , I hope .
All right .
That' s ... not why you came to apologize , is it ?
What do you mean ?
To soften me up for the deposition .
Of course not .
Um ...
I just want you to understand something .
Andrew is making accusations ... false accusations , saying that I abused him , all because I wouldn' t let him have his trust fund early so he could buy a car .
I mean , can you blame me for wanting to know if I have your support ?
And ... so ... what , you want me to lie ?
Make you look good ?
I actually don' t want anything of the sort .
Good .
Because when I give my deposition ,
I' m going to tell the truth .
To what do I owe this pleasure ?
I want you to look at something .
Myra Holt is talking to Paul Young , chatting away with him as though he were any other neighbor .
Now I told her he killed my Sister .
I mentioned it to her six months ago when we were standing in the express line at the market .
But still , there she is , yakking away .
Oh , Mike .
I' m afraid people' s memories aren' t what they used to be .
What do you want , Felicia ?
I wanna see how good your memory is , if you recall a certain promise you made to me .
- I am not gonna kill him .
- Why not ?
- Give me one good reason .
Because things have changed .
How ?
My Sister still lies rotting in the ground .
So does Dierdre .
No , I don' t see how anything' s changed at all .
You' re just gonna have to let this go .
Sounds to me as though someone' s let go of his rage .
Maybe I have .
Well , I haven' t .
And that bitch of a stripper lied to us .
The Father' s totally in the dark .
- He clearly wants to keep the baby .
- Mr. Solis , if the Father wants to assert his rights here , there' s nothing we can do .
I' il find you another baby .
I promise .
- I don' t want another baby .
I want this one !
- Oh , honey , he' s right , okay .
That trashy girl has been lying to us from the get- go .
Let' s just walk away while we can .
It' s not worth it .
Look , don' t get cold feet now , Gaby , please .
All right ?
Let' s just pay Frank the way we paid Libby and then bring the baby home .
- Wait , wait , wait ... you paid Libby ?
You said we could give her gifts .
Everybody loves getting cash .
I could probably be disbarred for even listening to this .
I cannot condone baby- buying !
And I sure as hell can' t be part of it .
Oh , Mr. Beale , come on .
No , no , hear me out .
If you are determined to go down this dark road , and unbeknownst to me steal this ... paternal rights waiver that' s sitting on my desk , and have this Frank guy sign both sides and date the top ,
I can' t be part of that , either .
Hmm .
Okay , l- I' m gonna go to Dad' s .
Oh , wait !
Why don' t you let me walk with you ?
Uh , shouldn' t you be resting ?
No !
I' m fine .
The Doctor said I should actually keep my blood flowing .
Well , do you have to do it while we walk over to Edie' s ?
I just ...
I don' t wanna risk you running into Dad .
Okay ... you guys have just been so chummy lately , and ... this whole flirting thing is kind of freaking me out .
Wait a second , we' re ... we' re not flirting .
Mom , you fed him eggs with your fork .
Okay , yes ,
I am closer to your Father than I have been in the past .
The bitter hatred' s now settled into a respectful disgust .
That' s the kind of thing most children of divorce dream about .
Hey , Edie .
What' s all this stuff for ?
Oh , hi !
Don' t tell anyone , but I' m planning a huge surprise for Karl .
A surprise ?
Yeah , I' m putting together an engagement party tomorrow afternoon .
Oh , cool .
But that' s not the surprise .
Actually , it' s gonna be a surprise wedding .
I know !
My Pilates teacher got ordained over the internet .
The , uh , church of the divine something or other .
I' m not sure .
Anyway , it' s all legal .
And , well , just one more day before I make an honest man out of your Daddy .
Oh !
You' re so sweet .
Thank you so much for your good wishes .
Oh .
No , Edie , wait .
Um , no , it' s just that ... you know , I was married to Karl , and I used to ... try to surprise him , and he would always , always , always say ...
" no , usan .
Don' t surprise me .
I don' t like it . "
Whatever .
I' m doing it , so keep your trap shut .
Now if you' il excuse me ,
I' ve gotta go and buy a wedding dress .
Oh , and by the way , I' il be wearing white , so that' il be a surprise for everybody .
( laughs )
I don' t know why I have to get dragged into this .
What happened with my kids has nothing to do with Bree' s situation with Andrew .
Sit .
Well , it' s my understanding that real harm could have come to your children as a direct result of your friend' s behavior .
I' m sorry , Mr. Bormanis , but I' m not gonna testify .
It just doesn' t feel right to me .
Well , this isn' t the first time someone' s felt the way you do .
So this isn' t the first time I' ve had to say that if you refuse to give a deposition of your own accord ,
I' il compel you to give one .
But I' m sure I won' t have to .
You' re saying Bree did this ?
While under the influence .
I understand your reluctance to turn on a friend , but this isn' t about you .
It' s about Andrew .
Don' t you think he' s suffered enough ?
How much are you gonna give him ?
I figured we could start with forty .
Thousand ?
He' s a bouncer in a strip club .
Offer him eight .
He' s not going to sell his baby for $8 , 000 .
Are we talking about the same idiot ?
I think for $8 , 000 , you throw in a kidney .
I' m not gonna blow this by bargain hunting .
You know , that' s your problem , Carlos .
Remember when you bought your car ?
You paid sticker .
Nobody pays sticker !
Okay , and what' s the sticker price on a child , huh ?
Tell me that .
I' m thinking $12 , 000 .
Frank , you have to sign the paper .
I made a deal with these people .
A deal ?
This isn' t a used car we' re talking about .
It' s our baby .
Before you screw this up , just remember that I can go to the cops and tell them about the pot farm you have going on in our basement .
It' s just a couple plants .
Yeah , I don' t do it for profits .
Hobby , mostly .
Oh , come on , Frank .
You know you would be a lousy Father .
It' s my kid !
And I have a right to mess her up if I want .
And if you go near the police , I' il tell ' em how you' ve been stealing all those tips from Sheila .
( gaby ) okay , we' re done .
Gaby , Gaby , no , just ... hold on .
Now maybe there' s a way that we can work this out together .
There is nothing to work out .
If Frank is not on board with this , it' s over .
Wait !
Uh ... it doesn' t matter what he wants .
Why not ?
Because it' s not your baby .
That' s a lie .
What if I took a paternity test ?
Will that shut you up ?
Wait , if it' s not Frank' s , then whose is it ?
I' m not sure .
All' s I know is ,
I got pregnant right after I worked at the Calgary rodeo , and I was very popular there .
So what are you saying , you screwed a bunch of cowboys ?
You have your hobbies ... and I have mine .
You think this is funny ?
Oh , don' t you get it ?
We just got our baby back .
Um ...
well , you take care now .
Ahem .
Yeah .
Hi .
I got , uh , your message that you wanted to see me before the meeting started .
Yeah , I did .
Um , there' s someone I' d like to introduce you to .
Bree , this is Donna .
Donna , this is Bree .
What' s up ?
Hi .
Donna is gonna be your new sponsor .
I , um , I don' t want a new sponsor .
I' m ...
I' m very comfortable working with you .
Look , this was always just a temporary arrangement .
And given what happened the other night ,
I think it' s best if we just end this now .
Peter , all we did was kiss .
We' d be kidding ourselves if we didn' t think that whatever' s between us isn' t going to affect our recovery .
It' s not a good time for change in my life , Peter .
Terrible things are happening .
I' m headed to court .
I need your support now more than ever .
You' il have support , Bree .
It just won' t be mine .
But , Peter ...
oh , Bree could never have done that !
I' m just telling you what the lawyer said .
So you think Bree punched Andrew in the face ?
' Cause I don' t .
I don' t either , but on the other hand , she spanked my kids , she lied about her drinking and I once saw her bitch slap her mother- in- law .
So I' m torn .
Well , I' m siding with Bree .
How can you be so sure ?
We have Andrew saying that it' s systematic physical abuse .
And then we have Bree saying it' s Andrew wanting to be emancipated so he can get at his trust fund so he can buy a car .
How are we supposed to know the real truth ?
Because I remember being 17 .
And I would' ve done a hell of a lot more than punch myself in the eye to get a car .
Karl !
Karl , stop !
Stop !
Oh !
It' s an emergency .
Just calm down .
What' s going on ?
- Edie is gonna marry you tomorrow .
- What ?
She' s planned this whole secret wedding .
It' s a surprise .
God , I hate surprises !
I know .
I told her that .
I said : " he always , always hates surprises . "
All right , don' t get yourself all worked up here .
Put our heads together .
We' il come up with something .
So the thing you gotta know about me is my style is proactive .
I don' t hold your hand if you go on a bender .
I believe in behavior modification .
Hmm .
Some muffins ?
Oh .
Oh , that' s okay .
I- i' m not big on snacks .
You should also know ...
I' m not a lesbian .
Oh !
Well , good for you .
Well , see , if I was , the program wouldn' t let me be your sponsor .
Not great for your recovery if we get tangled up in a little somethin ' .
So , um , whatever vibe you might be getting , that' s all on you .
Um , Donna ...
l- I really appreciate everything that you' ve been doing for me , but I think I was really making some progress with Peter as my sponsor .
And I was thinking ... all right , stop right there !
You' re fixating on Peter .
Well , I just really feel like I' m jeopardizing my recovery by switching ... you' re making cuses .
See , I have a 99 % success rate as a sponsor because I have 0 % tolerance for people who lie to themselves .
Now come on .
Come on ?
Where are we going ?
Hiking .
There' s nothing like it to take your mind off booze .
I got it !
I' il just be the woman .
I' il say I want a big wedding .
You know , the church , the big ballroom , smushing cake in her face ... it' il take months to plan .
That' s great .
And of course , I' il have to tell her you' re the one who ruined the surprise .
You' re gonna make me take the hit ?
Yeah .
Hey , guys .
What you doing out here ?
Uh , just talking .
Oh , well , come on in .
I' ve got something to show you .
Oh , no , that' s okay .
Come on !
You' il love this .
Wait until I leave to tell her , ' cause she' s gonna kill me .
Well , I should go .
I' m not gonna scream or cry or pound your faces in with a mallet , which , Lord knows , is my right .
But what I will say is that you two are the most reprehensible excuses for human beings that I have ever met !
Do you have anything to add ?
Right .
What the hell .
Oh !
Get out !
Get ...
hey , Mrs. Scavo .
That' s A ... that' s a sweet ride .
Yeah , you think so ?
Why don' t you come over here for a second ?
I' d like to pick your brain .
You' re the demographic that my client is interested in , so you' d actually be doing me a favor if you drove it around for a couple hours , and tell me what you thought .
Do you mind ?
Are you kidding me ?
I can' t believe you are old enough to drive .
I still remember when you were 10 years old .
I paid you a dollar to rake our leaves .
Yeah .
Yeah , you were pretty cheap .
Is this set up for MP3 ?
Uh , all the bells and whistles , but listen ...
I really wanted to tell you how sorry I am .
Hmm ?
Your lawyer came to see me .
I' m going to be deposed .
It' s going to be hard for me ... yeah .
Yeah , I know .
You just have to remember she' s a different person when she drinks .
She must be .
It' s hard for me to imagine the Bree I know capable of hurting you .
Yeah .
Do you have the keys ?
Oh .
Sure .
Anyway , I just ...
I feel so guilty that this all went on in your house , right under our nose .
So if there is anything I can do to help you ... well , can you get a discount on these ?
Um ... actually , yeah .
One of the perks .
Even so , it' s a little out of the price range of a high school student .
Well , if you tell my lawyer the truth ,
I don' t think money' s gonna be a problem .
Hi .
What' s going on ?
Edie wants to discuss our little ... deception .
Exactly how ugly is this gonna get ?
( edie ) how long does it take to shut a door ?
I can forgive your trickery .
I can forgive the humiliation .
But what I can' t forgive is the complete and utter lack of faith in me !
I mean , having Susan get married for insurance was my idea !
Okay , so if I' d known that everything had gotten all screwed up , of course I would' ve agreed .
Look , Edie , in retrospect ... yes , we didn' t think .
We didn' t handle this the way mature adults should have .
He' s right .
We behaved like children ... naughty , stupid children .
Well , that makes me feel better that you could admit that .
Because ... when naughty children misbehave , they know that they' re gonna get punished .
Don' t they ?
Punished ?
Mm- hmm .
At this point ,
I' d like to point out that , uh , it was Karl who proposed .
Karl .
You are gonna throw me an elaborate wedding .
Yes , of course .
Anything , baby .
How elaborate ?
Well , figure out exactly what it is that you could afford , and triple it .
As for you ... okay , now remember , I' m broke .
I' m well aware of your church mouse status .
I don' t intend to lift a finger during the planning and execution of this crushingly expensive wedding .
No .
No , of course not .
And anything I can do to help ... uh , you know , I would ...
I could help with how' s that ?
Well , I wasn' t planning on inviting you .
But ...
I will need a bartender .
Oh , oh , and , um ... make sure you come in through the back door .
You' re just in time .
Mrs. Scavo has been sworn in , so we' re all ready to start .
Hey .
Hi .
All right , we are now on the record .
Okay .
Isn' t it true that while your children were in Bree' s care , that she passed out drunk and allowed them to wander off to a downtown business district ?
My kids don' t wander .
They scurry , like rats .
- Excuse me ?
- Do you know a rat can fit through a hole the size of a quarter ?
Anyway , my children have that trick down , too .
Mrs. Scavo , are you saying that you don' t hold Mrs.
Van de Kamp responsible for endangering your children ?
No , I don' t hold her responsible .
Bree van de Kamp and I have known each other a long time .
I trust her completely .
She' s a wonderful friend and a fantastic mother .
She puts the rest of us to shame .
She' s lying !
Are you gonna let her get away with this crap ?
( bormanis ) please .
Do you consider Mrs. Van de Kamp to have a drinking problem ?
No .
Then why did you line empty wine bottles up on her front stoop ?
I was helping Bree with her recycling .
Do I need to remind you of the potential consequences of perjury ?
No , you don' t .
In fact , I hate liars .
Hello ?
Peter .
Hi , it' s Bree .
Hey , Bree .
You know , um , if you feel like you' re gonna need a drink , you should call Donna .
No !
No , l- I don' t feel like I' m gonna drink .
And if I did , I certainly would call Donna .
I mean , she and I are just ... we' re just really clicking .
Oh , that' s good .
So why are you calling ?
I know it' s really late notice , but a friend of mine , uh , got engaged and she' s throwing a party , and I thought , um , maybe you' d like to come .
Bree ... well , you' re not my sponsor anymore , so I assume this is allowable .
I mean , it' s just a casual get- together .
And they' re having sushi .
You do like sushi , don' t you ?
Bree ...
okay , Peter , I just really ... need us to be friends .
When I' m with you , I' m not myself , which is a good thing .
I can ...
I can relax when I' m with you in a way that I can' t when I' m with other people .
With them , I have to pretend that I have it all together , but ... you know that I don' t , so it' s just so much easier .
Come on , it' s just A ... it' s just a dumb old party .
Bree ... do not call me again .
Oh !
Paul !
I am so glad you made it .
I appreciate the invitation , Edie .
Although , frankly , I' m a little surprised to get it considering how people in this neighborhood feel about me .
Oh .
You know me .
I like to be inclusive .
Ooh !
It' s heavy .
Uh , unh- unh .
This is flat .
I think I' d like , um ... a rusty nail .
A what now ?
It' s a cocktail , well , I' m not really sure what' s in it .
But it sounds obscure and complicated , so chop- chop .
( carlos ) be right there .
Hey , hey .
Put that down .
We gotta go .
- Our birth mother just went into labor .
- What ?
- That' s fantastic !
- Yeah , can you believe it ?
We' re gonna be parents .
( laughs ) I' il go get the car .
Come on .
We were supposed to have four weeks .
She promised me the baby wasn' t due for four more weeks .
We don' t have anything !
We don' t ... we don' t have diapers , and we don' t have the stuff babies drink .
Formula .
You know , this is a total inconvenience .
Welcome to parenthood .
Come on .
This is your Father' s bartender bible .
- See if you can find a recipe for a rusty nail .
- Okay .
Um , Mom ?
Where' d you find that ?
It was stuck in here between a pink squirrel and a pisco sour .
Oh .
Well , why is your Father keeping this ?
Why you think ?
Hey , Susie .
Karl , this marriage ... our marriage , this fake marriage , that' s what it is , right ?
Fake .
What are you talking about ?
What' s this ?
Nothing .
- Yeah ?
- Mm- hmm .
Okay , then , repeat after me .
" Our marriage is fake ,
" and I' m going to marry the woman I really love ...
Edie Britt . "
If that' s what you want me to say .
No , no , no , no !
It' s not about what I want you to say .
You have to want to say that you want to marry Edie .
Don' t worry about this , Susie .
Why are you hanging on to that ?
I need to look at it from time to time .
Why ?
Consider it my punishment .
For screwing up the best thing that ever happened to me .
Oh .
Oh , no , no , no .
This is not happening .
No , wha ... mmm .
Mmm !
Oh , Karl !
Oh !
Will you ...
- Are you crazy ? !
- Just tell me what to do , Susie .
If you want me to marry Edie , I will .
You want me to call off the wedding , I' il do it .
- I' il do whatever you want .
- I' m putty .
( edie ) Karl !
Whoa !
What are you doing ?
I' m , just , uh , putting away some coats .
Oh .
Well , it' s time to open my presents .
Let' s go .
Oh , hello .
Hi .
Hi .
Um , I need some advice from a professional .
I' d like to get stinking drunk .
Do you have anything that can accomplish that in a hurry ?
I forgot the lamaze book in my purse !
Oh , forget it .
Come on .
Let' s go .
We' il wing it .
Oh , we missed it !
The kid just slipped right out .
Are you family ?
They' re the parents .
Would you like to help ?
No , thanks .
You guys look like you got it covered .
Oh , are you sure , honey ?
Come on , Gaby .
I just , um ...
l- I don' t wanna do anything to screw it up .
She won' t break .
Here .
Okay .
Hi .
Hi .
Oh , honey , you were right .
About what ?
It was all worth it .
- Serving bowls .
- Just what I needed , Lynette .
There' s a gift receipt taped to the bottom of the box .
Oh .
Thank God !
Okay , the next one is from Felicia .
I do hope you like it .
Oh , you know what they say ... good things come in small packages .
What is it ?
Teeth ?
Dentures .
They were my dear Sister Martha' s .
I' m sure none of you knew , but she had orthodontic issues from the time she was a ild .
Oh .
Thank you .
I know it' s an unconventional gift for an engagement party , but you and Martha were such close friends , Edie .
I wanted you to have something truly personal to remember her by , since she left us so ... abruptly .
You know , when Paul Young strangled her , crushed her windpipe and buried her alive next to a garbage- strewn hiking trail .
Felicia , uh ...
I think you' ve had enough .

Temptation comes to all of us .
Whether or not we succumb depends on our ability to recognize its disguise .
Sometimes it arrives in the form of an old flame , flickering back to life .
Or a new friend who could end up being so much more .
Or a young child who awakens feelings we didn' t know we had .
And so we give in to temptation , all the while knowing come morning , we' il have to suffer the consequences .
