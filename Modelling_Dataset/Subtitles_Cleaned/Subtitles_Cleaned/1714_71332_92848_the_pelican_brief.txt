- [been] There' s been another murder .
You remember I said my friend gave the brief to a friend at the FBl ?
The FBl friend was killed yesterday .
How do you know ?
I was holding his hand .
He was shot ... ... in broad daylight in a crowd .
I' m very sorry .
I' m in New York now .
When can you come ?
You' il have to give me something I can confirm .
We get many calls from people claiming to know who killed Rosenberg and Jensen .
Something you can confirm ?
Please .
Such as ?
The name of the friend that was murdered in the car explosion .
Take your time .
Callahan .
His first name ?
Thomas .
Where did it happen ?
In New Orleans .
I think that should be enough .
All right .
What' s the name of the friend that worked at the FBl ?
Verheek .
Gavin Verheek .
Voyles ' Chief Counsel .
I think that' s more than enough .
I' il be on a plane this afternoon .
You must follow my instructions .
This is Gray Grantham .
That' s right .
Got it .
Did you follow my instructions ?
You must think I' m crazy .
Yes , I did ... ... till I checked New Orleans .
Callahan was ... ... killed exactly as you said .
I also check on Verheek .
According to the FBl ... ... they found his body 2 days ago ... ... in a hotel room early in the morning .
He' d been dead for at least 8 hours .
That can' t be .
Want to talk about the brief ?
Everyone I' ve told about the brief is dead .
I' il take my chances .
You can' t , under any circumstances , use my name ... ... or reveal how you got the information .
Or publish anything until I' ve left the country .
Agreed ?
Unless I can convince you otherwise .
You can' t .
May I sit down ?
Mind if I use a tape recorder ?
Interesting read , isn' t it ?
What' d the President say ?
He spoke to Voyles ... ... who will leave it alone for a while .
The President asked Voyles to back off ?
We thought it was just another shot in the dark .
Now I' m not sure .
That' s obstruction of justice .
Assuming the brief turns out to be true .
If it does , you' il be the fall guy .
I won' t be the only one .
The old Nixon two- step .
Don' t even think that name .
Look at the hopeful side , Irangate , Iraqgate ...
Good chance it won' t come out .
What' s up with Grantham ?
We got his car phone .
We haven' t been inside the home yet .
Why not ?
We almost got caught by the cleaning lady .
Grantham knows about the brief .
He called 3 White House aides today ... ... and God knows who else .
What made you hone in on this particular case so quickly ?
I remembered this piece that " Frontline " did a year ago ... ... about the young lawyer who originally filed the suit .
They said he' d committed suicide , but his family thought it was foul play .
After the assassinations , I called his family .
They said he had a depressive problem years before ... ... but medication had taken care of it .
His doctor confirmed what the family said .
They told the police they were not convinced it was suicide .
But the police closed the investigation .
Exactly .
That' s it .
That' s the brief .
Maybe we could ... ... finish up in the morning ?
I' il stay up and go over my notes ... ... while they' re fresh in my head .
Call me when you wake up .
Try and get some sleep .
I know it sounds silly , but ... ... would you sleep on the sofa ?
No problem .
Good night .
Listen ...
At the risk of sounding old- fashioned ... ... isn' t it time I knew your real name ?
Darby Shaw .
What made you pick me , Darby Shaw ?
Callahan was a fan .
Does the name Victor Mattiece mean anything to you ?
Money ... ... power ... ... influence ...
He' s made and lost several fortunes drilling for oil in south Louisiana .
In 1979 ... ... his oil company punched some holes in Terrebonne Parish and hit oil .
A lot of oil .
He needed governmental permission ... ... to dredge a channel though the marshlands to get the oil out .
Enter Mattiece , the great campaign contributor ... ... and as night follows day ... ... government permission to gouge through the endangered marshes .
Mattiece is that close to at least a billion dollars ... ... when Green Fund ... ... an obscure environmental outfit ... ... trots down to the U. S. District court in Lafayette and files a lawsuit ... ... to stop the entire operation .
Of course , Mattiece spares no expense to win the lawsuit .
I don' t think there' s a top law firm between Houston and New Orleans ... ... that he hasn' t hired .
Fucking PBS !
By the time the Green Fund lawyers ... ... all two of them ... ... wade in , the joint ventures ... ... limited partnerships and corporate associations ... ... form an impenetrable maze that makes Mattiece invisible .
Luckily for the Green Fund' s lawsuit ... ... the heart of the new oil reserve is near a natural refuge for waterfowl :
Osprey , egrets , pelicans , ducks , cranes , geese .
The pelican becomes the hero .
After 30 years of contamination by DDT and other pesticides ... ... the Louisiana brown pelican is on the brink of extinction .
Green Fund seizes the bird and enlists experts ... ... from around the country to testify on its behalf .
It takes 7 years for the pelican suit to go to trial in Lake Charles .
The 3- man jury , caring less about the pelicans than jobs ... ... votes in favor of Mattiece .
But the judge rules to keep the injunction against drilling because ... ... he thinks Green Fund has proven its point about the pelican ... ... a federally- protected species , and that it will appeal .
What' s the lawsuit' s status ?
From the trial level ... ... it will be appealed to the Court of Appeals in New Orleans in a month .
Any idea what the court will do ?
It could be reversed .
Then the fun starts .
If either side is unhappy with the court ... ... they can appeal to the Supreme Court .
From today , how long would it take for a decision by the Supreme Court ?
Anywhere from 3 to 5 years .
Rosenberg would have died .
But another president could be in the White House when he died .
So if you' re Mattiece ... ... and you don' t mind killing a couple of Supremes ... ... now' s the time to kill them , when you can predict their replacement .
But why Jensen ?
He shared one piece of common ground with Rosenberg :
Protecting the environment .
I didn' t mean to wake you .
You said that Mattiece hired law firms from Houston to New Orleans .
Were there any in Washington ?
Maybe two .
White & Blazevich ...
... and Brim , Stearns & Somebody .
Great !
I got a call from a lawyer in D. C ... ... who saw something concerning Rosenberg and Jensen .
He backed out of our meeting .
I never heard from him again .
He gave me a phony name , but I got his picture .
How ?
Long story .
If he works at one of these law firms , he could be our confirmation .
I hope you find him .
Come with me to Washington .
I' ve had enough .
If you' re right about Mattiece , then there' il be a cover- up .
It' il probably work .
How do you know ?
I called the Herald morgue last night .
Two years ago , a reporter did a piece ... ... on " Violations of Campaign Financing Laws . "
He found out that , hidden under a lot of other names of individuals ... ... and PAC' s and corporations , Mattiece was the biggest contributor ... ... by far ... ... to the President' s campaign .
We ran a picture , with the article , of the President and Mattiece .
It was taken unbeknownst to either one .
In it , the President and Mattiece are in front of Mattiece' s hunting lodge ... ... sipping on some bourbon , having a good laugh .
The best of pals .
The captions said :
" The President' s Most Secret ...
" ... and Generous Contributor . "
Now , if your brief is right and it ever reaches the light of day ... ... the President loses any chance of reelection .
The men around the President won' t let that happen .
I checked with my sources .
The Bureau , Langley , the White House ... ... all said the brief doesn' t exist .
You may be the only witness to the fact there is a brief .
If you disappear ... ... so does justice .
Is that what Callahan would want ?
He' d want me to see my 25th birthday .
If this thing reaches as deep and goes as high as we think it does ... ... they' il do anything not to be exposed .
Where can you hide ?
Go back to Washington .
They' il all shook up about you asking about something .
I expected that .
It' s like the Gestapo over there .
Coal clears everything .
They put me on medical leave for 90 days .
- What' s wrong with you ?
- I don' t know .
One thing I do know , I' ve never seen it this bad .
I' m worried about you , son .
Gray , it' s Darby .
When you hear this , I' il be in the air on my way to nowhere .
Try to understand .
I can' t keep you on that story .
I' m sending you to Arkansas .
The Times , the networks ... ... are there checking out the judge they' re about to nominate .
I need more time .
For what ?
You lost your White House sources , you' ve lost Garcia and the girl .
Not your best week .
You can' t take me off this story .
What do you know for fact ?
An unidentified guy says he knows about the assassinations .
He works in a law firm ; you don' t know which one .
He' s cut off all contact .
That' s not very promising .
There' s something there , I can smell it .
Evidence based on olfactory prowess is inadmissible , in case you didn' t know .
Then there' s a girl ... ... with her bird brief for which you can' t get confirmation .
Yet .
She also cut off contact , something that' s reaching epidemic proportions .
They' re waiting for you upstairs .
Everything she said about the two deaths has been confirmed .
The FBl says Verheek was killed in some hotel mugging .
- That' s what you told me .
- That' s what they told me .
And they said they knew of no connection with the assassinations .
- What else would they say ?
- I' m interested in what they did say .
Let' s look at what I have confirmed .
Callahan was killed in a car explosion .
They had an affair .
Give it to the Times- Picayune .
Maybe they want some gossip .
I also found that Callahan clerked for Rosenberg 20 years ago .
Life is filled with odd coincidence .
Not a coincidence if the brief -
You have no confirmation there is a brief .
I confirmed Verheek and Callahan were friends .
They met here a few weeks ago , when he must have given him the brief .
- Supposition again .
- I' ve confirmed the pelican lawsuit .
On which she has based her suppositions .
It' s all just suppositions .
You know what Mattiece could do ?
I know what he has done already .
He has a bizarre history .
So do I , according to my ex- wife .
It doesn' t mean that I killed the Justices .
But it means it' s worth exploring .
Go down to that crappy cabin of yours on the weekend , hole up , retrench .
Prove you have a way to revitalize this story , and I might keep you on it .
But if I were you , I' d check where to eat in Little Rock .
This is the story of a mystery that may never be solved .
The story of a brilliant young lawyer who loved this land ... ... and wanted to fight to preserve it from the inroads of man ... ... until his abrupt death ... ... a few months ago .
His body was found in a lonely cottage , near the bayou he so loved .
There was a bullet in his head ... ... and a gun beside him .
The coroner and police have deemed it a suicide .
But he died sitting at a computer , surrounded by his notes ... ... for what he called the case he was born to win .
His friends and family ask ... ... would anyone commit suicide in such a manner ... ... at such a time ?
Tonight , Frontline explores the death of a young idealist .
Who' s there ?
It' s Darby !
I got your message .
If they bugged your phone , I wanted them to think I left the country .
Did you find that lawyer in D. C. ?
Not yet .
My editor wants to take me off the story .
I could help you find him .
How' d you find me ?
I called your editor .
He told you ?
I told him I was your sister Mary from out of town and couldn' t find you .
How' d you know I had a sister Mary ?
You' re not the only one doing research .
It was a beautiful service .
I' il have an announcement after the weekend .
It was the right thing to do , no matter where the body was found .
You can' t announce the nominations next week .
You said they' d be vetted this weekend .
There must be a change in plans .
I don' t understand .
The Pelican Brief .
What about the Pelican Brief ?
I thought that was ancient history .
We believe that Grantham' s gotten a hold of it .
Mattiece will sue the pants off them if they try to publish that .
Not if it' s true .
You think it' s true ?
I know what Grantham will write :
" A man who gave the President millions ...
" ... had two Supreme Court Justices killed so his pal , the President ...
" ... could appoint more reasonable men to the bench ...
" ... so that his oil could be harvested . "
If Voyles says you told him to back off the case , we face an obstruction charge .
Oh , Jesus !
There' s a way to handle this .
Handle it how ?
We appoint two nature- lovers to the court .
Good environmentalists who' d kill Mattiece and his oil field .
Meet with Voyles , in the presence of the Attorney General ... ... and demand an immediate investigation into Mattiece .
I' il leak copies of the brief to every reporter in town .
Then we ride out the storm .
But there has to be some way to keep this information from coming out .
I' m working on it .
What ?
How ?
Mr. President ... ... you don' t want to know .
What' s this all about ?
A trip to Mt .
Vernon will do you good .
Are you losing it ?
First I order you to go to Little Rock , you refuse to go .
You refuse to tell me why , then you order me ... ... your boss , I might add ... ... to drop everything and meet you at George' s place .
I thought of making you unemployed ... ... but you' d sue me for discrimination .
She' s here .
- The bird girl ?
- She' s here .
- You could' ve told me .
- Not wise .
By the way , refusing to tell me where you could be reached ... ... didn' t leave a good impression .
It' s too risky to go to my apartment or to the job .
- Where have you been ?
- In a little hotel .
This is a hell of a time to punch notches in your belt .
We' re not in the same hotel .
She' s helping me find Garcia .
It sounds like she' s in control .
It' s the only way she' d play .
So what if you can' t find Garcia ?
- We go to plan B.
- What' s that ?
- We attack the lawyers directly .
- What if it' s another firm ?
- We go to plan C.
- What' s that ?
- We didn' t go that far .
- What if you do ?
I must be able to get in touch with you .
I' m at the Marbury Hotel , room 833 .
Don' t use my name .
Write it down .
You mind getting off at the next exit ?
Why ?
A tan car' s been two cars behind us ... ... since we got on the parkway .
I thought it was following us .
Right .
Georgetown Law School , please .
Hurry .
Meet me by the stacks .
Someone was in my room .
Did you tell anyone where you were ?
Smith Keen , but he' d never repeat it .
Did you tell him by phone ?
We were ...
We were in his car .
- Georgetown Law Center .
- Placement office , please .
- One moment , please .
- Placement office .
This is Susan Johnson .
I' m a partner with White & Blazevich .
We' re trying to reconstruct some payroll records .
May I have the names of your students that clerked here last summer ?
I' m from White & Blazevich .
You have something for me ?
Would you sign this , please ?
- Thank you , Mr. Stevens .
- You' re welcome .
I' il call these 5 and see who' s home .
I' il take the two with no phone number and get their class schedules .
See you later .
I' m Gray Grantham from the Washington Herald .
I' m looking for ...
- ...
Robert Akers and Laura Kaas .
- Is there a problem ?
Just a few questions I want to ask .
Are they in class this morning ?
One moment , please .
Excuse me .
Do you have I. D. ?
Could I speak to Dennis Maylor , please ?
I' m Keith Maylor .
I' m sorry to bother you .
Akers has Criminal Procedure .
Kaas has Administrative Law .
I' il try to find them .
Maylor , Reinhart and Wilson were all at home .
I can go to Maylor' s .
Excuse me .
- Do you know Laura Kaas ?
- She' s the girl with the red backpack .
Do you recognize this man ?
He' s a lawyer at White & Blazevich .
We' re down to Akers and Linney .
Linney' s phone was disconnected .
I' il get his class schedule .
I' il keep looking for Akers .
It' s me again .
I need the class schedule for Edward Linney .
I' m sorry , Mr. Grantham .
One of the students you talked to called White & Blazevich , who called the Dean .
No more class schedules for reporters .
Mr. Grantham .
I know Edward .
He' s dropped out of school for a while .
Personal problems .
Where is he ?
His parents put him in a private hospital .
He' s being detoxified .
Look , he' s a good guy .
Parklane Hospital .
Good afternoon .
I' m here to see Edward Linney .
- What room is he in ?
- What' s your name ?
Gray Grantham , Washington Herald .
The law school said I could see him .
I' m sorry they did .
We run this hospital and they run their law school .
May I see your administrator ?
I' il see if I can find him .
Great architecture .
I' m sorry , Mr. Grantham .
Visitation is only allowed on the weekend ... ... and then only family .
When will he be discharged ?
I' m afraid that' s confidential .
Perhaps when his insurance expires ?
Do you recognize that man ?
What' s his name ?
That' s the point , I don' t know .
What is his name ?
He works in the oil and gas section on the 9th floor .
Morgan .
Morgan .
His first name' s something like ... ... Charles , but that' s not it .
I can' t tell you how grateful I am .
When you opened the door ... ... I thought I was hallucinating .
I' m sorry .
I' il take a hallucination like that ... ... anytime .
Take care of yourself .
Excuse me , miss .
What' re you doing ?
Visiting my brother .
Who is your brother ?
Edward Linney .
This your sister ?
Leave her alone .
Mom will come on the weekend .
Sis ?
Come back soon .
I' il try .
I know you' d agree with me about the horrendous cost of health care .
Of course , of course .
We pride ourselves on our enlightened policy regarding payment .
Thank you very much for your time .
We' il be happy to have you back on any of our normal visiting days .
Curtis Morgan , oil and gas .
White & Blazevich , please .
Second floor .
Use the escalator .
May I help you ?
Dorothy Blythe , to see Curtis Morgan .
Have a seat .
I' il be right with you .
- You have a meeting with Mr. Morgan ?
- Yes , at five .
- When did you make the appointment ?
- 2 weeks ago .
May I ask why ?
Obviously , I need an oil and gas lawyer .
Curtis Morgan is dead .
Why didn' t anyone call me ?
We have no record of your appointment .
What happened ?
He was mugged a week ago .
Shot by street punks , we believe .
Do you have some identification ?
He' s Security .
Security for what ?
Come with us , you should see someone else .
After this treatment , I have no interest in talking to anyone in this firm .
They killed him !
I can' t breathe !
It' s all right .
Just let it go .
Let it go .
It' s all right .
We ran the story about a week ago .
It' s just another mugging .
Didn' t make the Metro front page .
Curtis Morgan ... ... 225 Willow Road , Bethesda .
225 Willow Road ... ... Bethesda .
That' s what I wanted .
Report in before noon tomorrow .
We' re nervous over here .
You know ... ... good help is hard to find .
I' m going with you .
Look at me .
I want you to leave .
And if you need confirmation for your story ?
I' m on my own .
What' s changed your mind ?
I want you to reach 25 .
I' m coming .
This is Anne .
Good evening .
I' m Grantham of the Herald .
This is my assistant .
- Could we see Mrs. Morgan ?
- I' m her father .
She won' t talk .
I respect her privacy .
I know she' s been through an ordeal .
When did you people ever respect anyone' s privacy ?
I feel that way about most reporters .
But her husband called me ... ... three times before he died .
I don' t believe his death was accidental .
She doesn' t want to talk .
Get the hell out of here .
You change your mind ... ... I' il be at this number .
This is Mrs. Morgan .
Do you still want to see me ?
Did you know your husband called me ?
How would he know anything about those dead judges ?
I have no idea .
Did he keep any ... ... unusual documents ... ... or papers ?
We have a lock box at the bank for deeds and wills .
I looked at it last Thursday .
There was nothing unusual in it .
On Saturday morning ... ... I was going through his ... ... desk in the bedroom .
I found something a bit unusual .
A key .
A key to what ?
Another lock box .
Which bank ?
Riggs Bank .
We' ve never banked there .
And you knew nothing about this other ... ... box ?
Not until Saturday morning .
I figured ... ... I' il run by when I felt up to it .
Maybe you should check it , Mrs. Morgan .
Could be a clue to who killed him .
Are you saying Curtis was killed ... ... because he knew something about these assassinations ?
That' s exactly what I' m saying .
Do you think there may be papers in the safe deposit box ... ... that may reveal what Curtis knew about the assassinations ?
There could be .
My child' s lost one parent .
I can' t let her lose another .
I' il check it for you .
No one has to know you have the key .
They will only give it to his wife .
My partner' s a woman .
She' s trustworthy .
I would have one condition .
If you find something that disparages my husband in any way , you can' t use it .
You have my word , Mrs. Morgan .
Where are the safe deposit boxes ?
Down those steps .
I need access to a box , please .
- The number , please ?
- 616 .
This box was rented 2 weeks ago .
- I assume you' re Mrs. Morgan ?
- Sara Ann Morgan .
- The address ?
- 225 Willow Road , Bethesda .
- Phone number ?
- 301- 555- 7128 .
Who rented this box ?
- My husband , Curtis D. Morgan .
- And his social security number ?
510- 96- 8686 .
Will you sign here , please ?
May I help you ?
I' d like to rent a box .
Will you have a seat ?
I' il be with you in a minute .
Your key ?
Yes , I do .
Follow me .
It' s a four- page affidavit ... ... signed under oath .
It' s dated the day before the last time he called me .
He worked at White & Blazevich in the oil and gas section for 5 years .
Listen to this !
During that time ... ... he worked for a client who was engaged in a lawsuit in Louisiana .
The client was a man named Victor Mattiece ... ... who he' s never met .
Lots about the lawsuit , how desperate Mattiece was to win it .
Just as if you wrote it .
A partner named Sims Wakefield ... ... supervised the case for W & B. Morgan worked on a peripherated case .
He took files and documents that Wakefield left for him ... ... not related to the case .
When he got back to his own office ... ... he found a handwritten memo on the bottom of the stack .
He' d inadvertently taken it from Wakefield' s desk .
A copy of the memo is attached to the affidavit .
He copied the memo and left the memo under the files on his desk .
Next stop , Washington Herald !
Stop !
Get out of the car !
There was a car explosion in a garage near the Riggs Bank .
The police traced the car to a leasing agency .
It was rented yesterday by Grantham .
Have you heard from Grantham ?
Not since yesterday .
I should' ve taken him off that story .
What story ?
See what you can find .
Smith Keen ... ... meet Darby Shaw .
What the hell is going on ?
Sweetheart , I' m down here in the basement .
It' s about two in the morning .
This is an affidavit ... ... concerning a memo I found on my desk .
I' m going to trust you to do with it what you will .
The memo' s from Velmano , he' s a senior partner .
It was dated September 28th ... ... addressed to Wakefield and it read :
" Sims , advise client research is complete .
" The bench will sit much softer if the old man is retired .
" The second retirement is a bit unusual .
Jensen , of all people .
" Advise further that the pelican should arrive here in 4 years ...
" ... assuming other factors . "
There' s no signature .
Then Justices Rosenberg and Jensen were killed .
I firmly believe that this is the work of Mattiece and his associates .
Memo doesn' t mention Mattiece , but it refers to a client .
Wakefield had no other clients .
And no client had as much to gain from the new court .
I thought that I was protecting us by not revealing what I found .
You' il only see this if I' m gone , so I will have failed .
I' m sorry , sweetheart .
I' il always be with you .
Always .
This is Marty Velmano .
What a pleasure !
What can I do for you ?
We' re doing a story about Victor Mattiece ... ... and his involvement in the deaths of Rosenberg and Jensen .
Great !
We' il sue you for the next 20 years .
You' il be named as a defendant .
Oh , this will be great .
Victor Mattiece will own the Herald .
Have you heard of the Pelican Brief ?
We have a copy of it .
We also have a copy of a memo sent by you to Sims Wakefield ... ... in which you suggest your client' s position would be greatly improved ... ... by the removal of Rosenberg and Jensen from the court .
I noticed you waited till five .
An hour earlier , we could' ve run to court , stopped this .
You deny you wrote the memo ?
It' s a fabrication .
You have no lawsuit , Mr. Velmano .
You know it .
You son- of- a- bitch !
Mr. Coal ?
Have you read the Pelican Brief ?
I have .
We' re running a story which verifies the facts set forth in that brief .
We' ve confirmed Mattiece contributed over $4 million ... ... to the President' s last campaign .
4, 200, 000 , all through legal channels .
That' s right .
We believe the White House tried to obstruct the FBl investigation ... ... and we wonder if there are any comments .
The White House denies any direct or indirect involvement ... ... in this investigation .
You' ve received some bad information .
Mr. Voyles , it' s Grantham .
We' re running a story detailing a conspiracy ... ... in the murders of Rosenberg and Jensen .
We' re naming Mattiece , an oil speculator , and two of his lawyers .
We believe the FBl knew about Mattiece ... ... but didn' t investigate at the urging of the White House .
Any comments ?
I think we' il have great success with these people .
They were really very pleased ... ... and genuinely cooperative .
What' s up ?
You know Gray Grantham .
And this is Darby Shaw .
So you' re the little lady who started this great brouhaha .
I think you have me confused with the President' s friend .
I have some comments for the record .
First , we got the Pelican Brief two weeks ago ... ... and submitted it to the White House on the same day .
It was not considered high priority in the investigation until Gavin Verheek ... ... Special Counsel to the Director , was found murdered .
Did the White House interfere in the FBl investigation of Mattiece ?
I' il discuss it ... ... off the record .
Last Wednesday the President asked me to ignore Victor Mattiece as a suspect .
In his words ... ... he asked me to " back off . "
I have a tape ... ... which I will allow no one to hear ... ... unless the President first denies this .
So what do you do now ?
There' il be a grand jury by noon tomorrow .
Quick indictments .
And we' il find Mattiece .
I' d like a few minutes alone with Ms. Shaw .
- If she doesn' t mind .
- It' s her call .
I' d like Mr. Grantham to stay .
What' s next for you ?
Who killed the man disguised as Verheek ?
Oh , you mean the assassin , Khamel .
Off the record , Khamel was killed by a contract operative ... ... hired independently by the ClA .
Rupert ?
He probably has 20 names .
Why was he following her ?
I think the brief initially scared Giminski more than anyone .
And he probably ... ... sent Rupert ... ... to trail Darby ... ... in part to watch and in part to protect .
We can help .
What do you want ?
To leave the country , alone .
All right .
We' il get you out of this building , put you on my plane .
We' il fly you anywhere you want and you can disappear .
But you must allow me to contact you ... ... through Mr. Grantham ... ... if , and only if , it becomes urgently necessary .
That' s fine .
I want no one on the plane but me , Gray and the pilots .
After takeoff , I' il tell the pilot where to go .
He has to file a flight plan before he can leave .
You' re the Director of the FBl .
Set it up .
Our guest today is Gray Grantham ... ... who has , as just about everyone in America knows ... ... revealed the plot behind the assassinations of Rosenberg and Jensen .
The ripple effects of this story just don' t seem to stop .
As of this broadcast , Victor Mattiece , one of the country' s richest men ... ... has been indicted , along with 4 aides and lawyers .
Fletcher Coal , the President' s Chief of Staff , has resigned .
And we' re getting strong indications that the President himself ... ... will not run again .
That' s what we know .
Let' s get to what we don' t .
We know the Pelican Brief was written by a woman named Darby Shaw ... ... but we don' t know who that is .
Who is Darby Shaw ?
That' s a question for Darby Shaw .
That leads me to my next question .
Speaking for many of our colleagues ... ... who are in a feeding frenzy to interview her ... ... where is Darby Shaw ?
That' s also a question for Darby Shaw .
But she' s not available ... ... to answer questions until the feeding frenzy stops .
Does that mean you don' t know where she is ?
I didn' t say that .
Then you do know .
I take it this cryptic smile means ... ... you' re not answering .
In view of all this , you know that ... ... there' s speculation ... ... that this woman is a figment of your imagination .
That you created her from a lot of different sources .
Just as there are people who believe there was no Deep Throat ... ... there are those who believe there is no Darby Shaw .
In other words , she' s just too good to be true .
She almost is .
