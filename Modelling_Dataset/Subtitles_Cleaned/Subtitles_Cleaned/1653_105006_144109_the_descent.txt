Paddle !

- Mummy !
( Shrieking )
Come on !
Hold on !
Christ !
Yes !
- Hi , guys !
Oh , Jessie .
Yeah !
( Laughs ) That was amazing .
( Girls laugh )
- Oh , you girls were screaming .
- All right , Jessie ?
- That wasn' t so bad , was it ?
- No , it was a piece of piss .
Whoo !
Bitch !
- Bit more , bit more .
- Go on , Paul .
Fish her out .
There .
Got you .

It' s freezing .
I can' t feel my fingers .
Heave !
Ah , come here .
Oh , babe .
Come on , Jessie , it' s freezing .
Let' s go back to the car .

- All right .
It' s OK , you go on .
We can finish up here .
You sure ?
Thanks , guys .
I' il see you at the hotel .
See you .
Jess , shall I phone Rachel' s mum ?
See if Rachel wants to come to dinner on Thursday ?
Yeah ?
OK .
- Are you going to invite any boys this time ?
- ( Laughs )
Are you OK ?
You seem a bit distant .
I' m fine .
( Tyres screech )
( Monitor beeps )
( Flat- line tone )
Jess ?
Jessie !
( Panting )
Jessie !
Sh , sh .
I' m sorry .
She' s gone .
- I' m sorry .
- No !
No , no .
No , no , no .
She' s gone , Sarah .
Shh .
- ( Wails ) - Shh .
( Banjo music )
- ( Music changes to gospel ) - Well , it' s mud , blood and beer ... or sweet Jesus .
Great .
Turn that shite off .
That' s frightening .
Listen , we don' t have to do this , you know .
We can head back and stay in town .
Get wasted , go to a barn dance .
Now that is frightening .
You' re right , we don' t have to do this .
But I' m not going to be the one to tell Juno .
She' s a piece of work , man .
She always brings us out into the middle of ...
Well , look at it .
- She came to Scotland last year .
- Yeah , and left pretty quickly .
( Whoops )
Sarah !
Beth !
Juno .
You look fantastic .
Ah , come here .
Oh .
Let me look at you .
Wow !
Everything is going to be fine .
Better .
It' s going to be great .
Becca and Sam can' t wait to see you .
Why don' t you go in ?
- Give me these .
- Yeah .
Thanks .
- OK ?
- Yeah , OK .
- How is she ?
- Well , she' s here .
One step at a time , eh ?
Hello .
- You do look really good .
- Oh , you look amazing .
- Hey !
- Let me put the bags down .
Oh , so nice to see you .
- We' re starving .
- OK , go , go .
- What have you got ?
- Er , well , there' s a bit of ...
Sam .
Sam .
Thank you so much for your letter .
It meant a lot to me .
Oh , Sarah , look , I' m so sorry that I couldn' t be there .
You know , mid- terms and ...
You know , Sam is going to be Doctor Van Ney in like a year' s time .
No !
- Please tell me it' s longer than that ?
- I am so proud of my little sister .
- Who wants a drink ?
- Yes !
Me !
- Brandy shot ?
- Yeah , yeah .
- So , Beth ...
- Mm- hm ?
I hear it all starts falling apart past 25 ?
ls that what they teach you at medical school , yeah ?
To take the piss ?
- Cheeky bitch !
- Ow !
Can anyone make me feel any older ?
- Hello .
- Hi , you must be the teacher .
- Beth , Sarah , this is Holly .
Juno' s protégé .
- I always thought Juno would eat her young .
- Oh , nice .
I' m well able to handle myself , thanks very much .
I' ve heard about you .
You' re that mentalist that jumps off buildings .
- Base jumping .
You should try it , seriously .
- So you live in America now ?
Ran out of things to jump off in Galway , you know .
I' m always searching for the next big high .
- Sure you' d know all about that .
- Sorry ?
Juno showed me a photo of when you used to climb together .
I found this classic picture .
Ah !
- Oh , no !
- Oh , no !
- Look at the state of us !
- Oh , my God .
That' s bad .
Love each day .
Used to be something Paul used to say .
Anyway ... cheers .
Here' s to our adventure .
- Skol .
- Cheers .
Come on , light , you bastard .
So , have you done Boreham Caverns before ?
I saw it in a book once .
It' s for tourists .
It' s not adventure .
Might as well have hand rails and a fucking gift shop .
lf you' re a caver , jumper , climber ... you just do it and not give a shite .
Or the thing that' s bigger than you will get you .
JUNO :
What ?
Holly , tomorrow is going to be awesome .
OK ?
- Take this .
You need it .
- ( Chuckles )
SARAH :
SAM :
Different ... shifts .
Oh , my God .
- Oh , my Jesus !
- What do you think , eh ?
( Laughter )
Don' t say a fucking word , all right ?
It was a Christmas present .
Shut up .
- What about you Holly ?
Got a man ?
- Oh ...
I' m a sports fuck like Juno .
- What ?
- Rebecca , too , I think .
HOLLY :
JUNO :
( Birds calling )
( Wind chimes )
( Knock at door ) - Oh !
Wakey .
I feel like road kill .
Give me five minutes .
Five minutes .
( Screams )
Good morning , my little ones .
Wakey , wakey .
- Good morning .
- ls that what you call it ?
It' s fucking freezing !
Holly !
We' re leaving at seven .
Don' t be late .
Try that .
The queen is dead .
Long live ... the fucking queen .
( Laughter )
JUNO :
- lf you drive we' il never get there .
- Paper , scissors , stone .
- Come on .
- Oh , you' re a dick .
- Go on .
- OK .
- There you go .
- No , wait , babe .
Best of three .
I' il drive .
Right ?
Ladies , group photo .
You' d better hurry it up .
We' re running late .
- I look like shit .
- We all look like shit .
Just give me a smile .
- Hat ?
No hat ?
- No hat .
- Run , run , run , run .
- Say " sausage " !
ALL :
Sausage !
- Sarah , slow down a bit .
- I' m having fun .
She' s having fun .
Whoa !
Turn , turn , turn there .
- Let' s off road .
- Great .
You should have some water .
Trying to set this watch is impossible .
The buttons are too fucking small .
- Leave it alone .
- Why do you wear it , anyway ?
- My boyfriend gave it to me , it' s sentimental .
- It' s fucking mental .
Any guy that gave that to me , I' d dump him .
BETH :
- Relax , I' ve never been lost in my life .
- Marvellous .
- So have you done these caves before ?
- No .
But they are only level two .
Quite safe , don' t worry .
- I wasn' t .
- The only danger is that I might fall asleep .
Boreham Caves .
More like boredom caves .
- Nice parking .
- Thanks .
HOLLY :
REBECCA :
Rebecca , leave her alone .
OK , guys , let' s get moving .
We' re running late .
SAM :
Come on , keep up .
SAM :
Hey , Holly , wait up .
REBECCA :
Move it , short arse .
BETH :
Oi , Carter , get to the back .
HOLLY :
Come on , you lazy bastard .
JUNO :
You finally caught up with me .
- Juno , are we there yet ?
- There' s a river about half a mile ahead .
When we reach it , we follow it up to the mouth of the cave , OK ?
How does she know there' s a river up ahead ?
I can' t hear a thing .
She can probably smell it .
She came up here last week to check the route out .
- And rule number two ?
- Don' t go wandering off .
You think it' s dark when you turn out the lights .
Well , down there it' s pitch black .
- You can get dehydration , disorientation ...
- Yeah , yeah , yeah . - claustrophobia ...
- Blah , blah . panic attacks , paranoia , hallucinations , visual and aural deterioration ...
( Squawking )
Hey !
Eurgh .
Yeah , lovely , Holly .
A real Kodak moment .
- Don' t touch it .
- You wouldn' t want to piss it off .
- What do you think did that , Sam ?
A bear ?
What is this ?
Nature Detectives ?
- It could have been Big Foot .
Come on .
- Sam , stop poking it with a fucking stick .
This is it .
- You' re having a laugh !
- Afraid not .
I' m an English teacher , not fucking Tomb Raider .
You' il be fine .
JUNO :
Holly , safety first .
I don' t want any stunts this time .
- You OK ?
See you down there .
- No .
REBECCA :
Look , I have done this before , you know ?
- I' m only looking after you .
- And I appreciate it , in small doses .
JUNO :
It' s beautiful !
JUNO :
- Oh , shit !
Shit , shit , shit .
Oh , my God , I' m gonna die .
( Panting )
Ah , piece of piss .
Oh , my God !
- ( Shrieks ) BETH :
It' s Holly .
Shit , move !
Holly , you do this safely , in order , following my lead .
OK ?
Take it slow and easy .
HOLLY :
- Smart arse .
( Screeching ) ( Screams )
( Screams )
It' s OK .
It' s OK .
It' s OK .
They' re gone .
They' re gone now .
Look .
HOLLY :
50 bats .
( Grunts )
Holly , fuck off .
Which way ?
There' s only one way out of this chamber and that' s down the pipe .
OK .
JUNO :
It' s a drop .
( Clattering )
JUNO :
OK ?
JUNO :
Holly , chuck us your bag .
( Fizzing )
SARAH :
Oh , my God !
- ( Laughter )
( Squeaking )
( Water dripping )
- Jesus Christ !
- Come on , let' s eat .
- Holly , would you take a break ?
- I just want to take a few more shots .
This cave is a lot cooler than I thought .
Hey ?
Not hungry .
Are you OK ?
Juno , I won' t break .
I' m fine .
- I asked you for this .
- I know .
Um , Sarah ?
really sorry I didn' t stay around longer after the accident .
Anyway ... we' re all here for you now , OK ?
Yeah .
Look , sorry .
I' m feeling a bit out of it .
It' s probably jet lag .
- So I' m just going to take a look around , OK ?
- Yeah , OK .
Why don' t you try and find us the way through , huh ?
Hey , don' t go too far .
What' s up with her ?
She looks like she' s seen a ghost .
She' s fine .
( Water dripping )
I' ve found the next passage !
- That' s it ?
It' s a bit small , isn' t it ?
- Hey , hey , hey !
- I don' t get this .
- What ?
This is not how I imagined it from reading the book .
That' s why I don' t trust books .
Leaves too much room for interpretation .
Something wrong ?
- No .
- It' s nothing .
HOLLY :
Careful .
Just find the way through .
We' il wait here .
( Splashing through water )
( Echoing laughter )
( Laughter )
Sarah ?
- Shit .
Yes .
Shit !
( Strains with exertion ) Shit !
Sarah ?
Guys , it' s Sarah , I think she might be stuck .
BETH :
( Grunts )
I can' t fucking relax .
Fuck , fuck !
Sarah , you have to calm down and the only way you' re going to do that is to breathe .
( Sarah struggles for breath )
I can' t .
I can' t .
- I can' t fucking breathe .
Just listen to my voice , yeah ?
Sarah , I' m coming .
I' m coming back .
OK ?
OK .
Sarah , OK ?
Listen to me , keep breathing .
OK ?
Hey .
Hey , hey .
OK .
OK .
OK .
- Look here at me , Sarah , hey ?
What are you so worried about , Sarah ?
Look at me .
OK , breathe .
Breathe , OK ?
Hey , hey , hey .
Listen to me .
- Listen to me .
What are you so afraid of ?
- I can' t fucking move !
You move .
Sarah , look at me , look at me .
The worst thing that could have happened to you has already happened and you' re still here .
This is just a poxy cave and there' s nothing left to be afraid of , I promise .
OK ?
OK ?
Hey .
Hey , listen , listen .
Listen to me , you' il love this one .
How do you give a lemon an orgasm ?
God damn it , let me hear you say it .
How do you give a lemon an orgasm ?
What do you do ?
You tickle its citrus .
( Laughs )
OK , that' s better .
Come on .
OK , OK .
All right , we' re going to move now .
Take hold of my arm , all right ?
We' re going to move slowly .
That' s it , grab my arm , OK ?
OK , come on .
Just slowly .
Pull on me , OK ?
OK , come on .
The rope bag .
I forgot the rope bag .
OK .
( Rumbling and crashing )
OK , fuck the rope bag .
OK , move , now !
Now !
Hurry up !
Sarah , come on !
Sarah , keep hold of the rope !
( Muffled coughing )
( Coughing ) BETH :
Sarah ?
Oh , ah .
- Are you OK ?
- I' m all right .
JUNO : ls everybody OK ? ls everybody OK ?
- Don' t fucking touch me .
SAM :
Rebecca ?
REBECCA :
I' m here , I' m OK .
Beth , are you injured ?
No , I' m fine .
- Nobody move until the dust has settled .
- Don' t worry , Juno , we' re not going anywhere .
( Coughing )
HOLLY :
REBECCA :
Jesus .
HOLLY :
So what' s the story now ?
REBECCA :
According to the guidebook , this cave system has three ways out .
This is just one of them .
lsn' t that right , Juno ?
Check the book .
- I didn' t bring it .
- What ?
No point .
For Christ' s sake , Juno .
You filed a flight plan to mountain rescue ?
lf we don' t report in , they' il come looking for us .
That' s how it' s supposed to work except I put in a flight plan for Boreham Caverns and this isn' t Boreham Caverns , is it , Juno ?
We' re in the wrong fucking cave ?
Holly was right .
Boreham Caverns was a tourist trap .
- Don' t try and pin this fucking shite on me !
- This is not caving .
This is an ego trip .
JUNO :
Rebecca , I didn' t know this was going to happen .
This is exactly what we believe in .
We said , if there' s no risk , what' s the point ?
Don' t try and justify this .
Where ...
Where are we ?
It hasn' t got a name .
It' s a new system .
I wanted us all to discover it .
No- one' s ever been down here before .
- You' re fucking kidding me .
- Oh , God !
BETH :
HOLLY :
JUNO :
We have to find a way out of this chamber and keep pushing forward .
BETH :
JUNO :
We all lost something in that crash .
Just get us out of here .
JUNO :
But if we stay here , we' il die .
( Falling rubble )
JUNO :
- What ?
Don' t move , Sam .
Just don' t move .
Stay right there .
Oh , shit .
No more .
( Falling stone ) - Thanks , Beth .
Now I know how far down it is .
So , what now ?
One of us has to get all the way across there so they can rig a line for you guys .
I have three cams , I need at least three more .
Where' s the other rope bag ?
Where is it ?
We lost it , when the cave collapsed .
Sorry .
Help me .
( Shallow breathing )
( Grunting )
( Grunting )
- Aargh !
- You got it .
Come on , come on .
JUNO :
- Fuck .
What' s wrong ?
It' s nothing .
I' m all right .
OK .
( Gasps in frustration )
( Gasps ) ( Breathless ) All right , more slack .
More slack , thanks .
( Gasps )
Fuck !
( Panting )
Fuck , fuck , fuck .
- OK .
JUNO :
( Breathless ) OK .
Throw me the right rope .
OK .
OK .
Come on .
Yeah !
- Now , you make it look easy .
- Yeah , well , you make it look hard .
- Oh .
JUNO :
- Just keep going .
REBECCA :
You' re OK .
You' re safe .
Good .
There you go .
Was this about me or you ?
It' s about us , getting back to what we used to be .
I wanted us to claim this place , name it .
I thought maybe your name .
Or maybe yours .
REBECCA :
You' re doing well .
Come on .
Come on .
There you are .
Come on , give me your hand .
( Grunting )
( Unhooks cam )
Juno ?
We' il need everything we' ve got .
Fuck .
( Grunts )
Yes !
( Grunts )
Reach .
Aargh !
Juno !
No !
( Screams )
BETH :
( Grunting )
BETH :
Sam !
SAM :
Holly , let me pass .
SAM :
( Groaning )
Let go , let go .
- What does it mean ?
- It means we' re not the first .
It' s a piton , right ?
lf cavers were here , there' s a better chance of us getting out .
This equipment is at least 1 00 years old .
No- one uses stuff like this any more .
Besides , if anyone had been down here and made it out , they would have named it already .
( Groaning )
JUNO :
I' il live .
Holly , how does it look ?
OK , keep going .
We' il be right behind you .
HOLLY :
Hey , there' s something down here .
Guys , it' s amazing , but the batteries on our lights will run out .
- Wait a minute .
Wait .
- What is it , Beth ?
- Juno , light up one of your flares .
- We don' t have time for this .
- Just light a flare .
- Really lovely , Beth , but it' s fucking useless .
- No , look at it .
What do you see ?
and there' s two entrances .
- You are a fucking genius .
- I have my moments .
- This means there' s another way out ?
- Let' s find out .
Come on !
- Bastard !
- Which way ?
Holly , give me your lighter .
- Come on .
- Here .
Fuck !
- Come on !
Come on !
- Shit !
- That one !
- Hey !
Holly !
Holly , slow down !
JUNO :
HOLLY :
Daylight !
I can see daylight !
- Help me !
- Hold on !
Guys !
Hold ...
Holly !
Sam !
Get down here !
Holly !
I think I hurt my leg !
Oh , fuck !
( Screams ) No !
Fuck !
( Groans )
Someone better get down here !
- Oh , that' s fucking disgusting .
- Beth !
Not here , not now !
We need help .
Everybody grab a corner .
We need to move her out of the water .
Nice and easy now .
And ... lift !
Argh !
- You fuckers !
- Juno , find something to make a splint out of .
- It' s OK , I' ve got her .
- Hey , Juno , use one of the ice axes .
SAM :
You' il be all right , sweetheart .
( Child laughs )
OK .
- Sarah !
- Juno , I' m gonna need your help here .
- Sarah !
- Juno !
Take hold of her arm .
You' il have to hold her down .
What are you gonna do ?
I need to dress the wound and rig up a splint , but I can' t while the bone is protruding .
I need to push it back in .
- I hate you .
- I know .
Do it .
Bite down on this .
- Keep hold of her .
- Just fucking bite down , OK ?
- Go !
- ( Screams )
( Holly screams in distance )
Just keep biting down , baby .
Come on .
OK , someone get me a medical kit .
OK , OK , OK .
Calm down .
It' il be all right .
( Gasps )
( Panting )
- ( Gasps ) - What are you doing ?
I just saw something ahead in the tunnel .
Sarah , I promise you , I' m gonna get you out of here .
But I can' t do it unless you' re with me .
Sarah !
Sarah , look at me .
There' s nothing there .
That' s the best I can do .
It' il hurt like hell and you can' t put any weight on it , but at least you can move .
They combed these mountains centuries ago .
Anyone trapped would be a skeleton now .
- That is just what it looked like .
- What ?
- Sarah thinks she saw someone .
- Saw what ?
I don' t I saw someone , I saw someone .
No , you heard something and saw what you wanted to see .
- It' s the dark .
It plays tricks on people .
- I can describe exactly what I saw .
- What did you see ?
- A man .
I saw a man .
REBECCA :
- Yes !
And it' s not the first time .
I thought I saw someone before , but now I' m sure .
Look , if there is somebody down here , then maybe they can help get us out .
Sarah , there' s no- one down here .
Forget about it !
Hey , we have to get Holly out of here .
OK ?
This is all that matters right now .
- Beth !
- It' s OK .
ls it ?
Fuck !
Fuck me .
SAM :
BETH :
Why are we walking away ?
There was daylight back there .
JUNO :
It wasn' t .
It was phosphorus in the rock .
We' re two miles underground , the only light down here is ours .
HOLLY :
Argh !
Well , it looked like fucking daylight to me .
Right tunnel !
- I got you .
OK ?
( Holly moans )
( Groans in pain )
BETH :
Jesus !
What is this place ?
Holly , where' s the infrared button ?
SARAH :
BETH :
This is not good , guys .
REBECCA :
Can we get out of here ?
Which way ?
Come on .
- I don' t know .
BETH :
What do you mean , you don' t know ?
There' s no breeze .
It could be any one of these tunnels .
Take your pick .
Oh , fuck it !
Hello !
- Please !
- ls there anybody there ?
Hello !
( Screams )
JUNO :
It' s there !
It' s up there !
It' s there on the roof !
Fucking hell , did you see ... ?
What the fuck was that ?
I don' t know !
It moved so fast , I could barely see it !
- I' ve never seen anyone climb like that !
- I told you I saw someone !
- That was not a human being !
- Screw this .
Let' s take our chances and pick a tunnel .
Move !
( Screeching )
What' s happening ?
Oh , shit !
It' s circling us .
- Where is it ?
- This way !
Move !
- Holly !
We' ve got to move .
We' ve got to move .
- Come on !
Move it !
JUNO :
- Juno , the flare !
Get rid of it !
- Fuck !
JUNO :
Holly , keep moving , come on !
( Holly groans )
Holly !
Holly !
Sarah !
Holly !
Sarah !
Sarah !
Get off !
Get away , you fucker !
( Screeches )
( Screeches )
( Juno hyperventilates )
( Whimpers )
Oh , fuck .
My battery' s gone dead .
Where are they ?
What' s happened to the others ?
Becca , please say we' re gonna get out of here .
OK .
OK .
OK .
Go .
Go !
JESSlCA :
( Whispers )
( Coughs and splutters )
( Growling )
( Screeching )
( Low howl )
Oh , fuck .
Fuck .
Turn the light off .
Quiet .
( Squelching )
( Retches )
( Growls )
( Screeches )
JUNO :
Sarah !
It can' t see us .
( Beeping )
( Beeping )
( Beeping )
Sam ?
Becca ?
Becca !
( Echoes )
-
- It' s Juno .
JUNO :
The noise she' s making , she' il bring every one of those things down on her head .
As long as it' s not on mine .
Becca !
JUNO :
Anyone ?
Sam !
I' m sorry .
I' m sorry .
Oh ...
I' m sorry .
Fuck .
OK .
OK .
OK .
It' s all clear .
( Screeches )
Sam , run !
( Screeches )
We heard you crying for Sarah .
Where are the others ?
They ...
They took Holly .
Beth ...
Beth' s dead .
( Juno sobs )
Sam ... what is that thing ?
I don' t know .
Well , it does look human .
Come on , we need to find the way out before those things find us .
No .
Sam , tell us what we' re fighting .
Well ... they' re totally blind .
And judging from what we' ve seen , I' d say they use sound to hunt with .
Like a bat .
And they' ve evolved perfectly to live down here in the dark .
Whatever they are , they go to the surface to hunt .
And they bring their food back down here to eat , through an entrance .
Listen , if we can stay quiet enough and evade these fuckers ... l think I found the way out .
You think ?
The climbing gear we found - whoever brought that down here marked their route .
- I found those markings .
- Well , what are we waiting for ?
Sarah .
I' m not leaving without Sarah .
( Gasps ) Sarah !
Oh , God .
Oh , God .
Oh , God .
No .
Sarah ...
I' m getting you out of here .
( Groans in agony )
Don' t touch me .
Don' t touch me .
I heard Juno calling me .
I' m gonna go and find her , and we' re gonna come back and get you out .
No , stay away from her .
- What ?
- She did this to me .
- What ?
No , she didn' t .
No .
- Shh .
- Sarah ... ( Gurgles )
Don' t trust her .
You find your own way out .
It' s OK .
It' s all right .
I' m not gonna leave you , Beth .
I' m not gonna leave you .
I' m not leaving you here , OK ?
Come here .
Beth !
This is Juno' s .
It' s from Paul .
Oh , no .
Sorry .
( Sobs )
( Distant screeching )
Please ...
Oh , that' s them .
Please , come with me .
Please .
Sarah ... don' t leave me like this .
No , please don' t ask me to do that .
- Please .
- I can' t .
I can' t do that .
I can' t do that .
Please .
OK .
Ssh .
Close your eyes .

Hurry !

Look , she' s dead , Juno .
We can' t wait for her .

JUNO :
