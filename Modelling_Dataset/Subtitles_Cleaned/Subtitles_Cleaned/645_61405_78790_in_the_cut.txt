- [at] Not even at the end , when they gave him his lethal injection .
" He was chatty , " his guard said .
He wanted to discuss the Chicago Cubs and eat fried chicken .
I' m gonna take a sleeping pill .
Two , in fact .
Do you want one ?
No .
It' s so fucking noisy I can' t sleep .
I have to move .
I mean , clearly , I have got to move .
Why don' t you see him again .
You' re brave in so many ways .
You' re thinking about him , right ?
- About sex .
- So ?
You wouldn' t be thinking about the sex if you didn' t like him .
Well , at least call him .
He doesn' t know where you are .
I go to court tomorrow ... ... because of the tan suit .
They' re trying to get a restraining order against me .
Probably won' t be allowed within 500 miles of Dr. Cass ' office .
Yeah , laugh it up .
- You know what I' m thinking ?
- What to wear .
No , I' m imagining that when he sees me ... ... he' s gonna realize that he' s in love with me , and , you know ... ... one thing will lead to another , and after a love child or two ... ... we' il get married .
Have I ever told you how our father proposed to my mother ?
No .
Tell me .
Well , when he was very young , he was ... ... very handsome and an excellent skater .
And she was the new girl in town , barely able to skate .
She was very , very innocent .
Very beautiful .
Of course .
And he was already engaged , but he couldn' t stop watching my mother .
This is my song .
And finally ... ... his fiancee got very jealous and --
I would too .
And threw that engagement ring right back at him .
- Whoa .
- And that very same day ... ... he took my mother by the hand ... ... he danced her out to the middle of the forest- fringed lake ... ... he got down on one knee ... ... and offered her the very same engagement ring .
Oh , that' s nice .
And at that precise moment , which is the thing my mother always added ... ... it started to snow .
That' s very romantic .
I don' t quite believe it .
But that' s my mother' s story .
That' s the way she always told it , you know .
He killed her .
When he left , she just went crazy with grief .
You know , she didn' t understand it .
She just couldn' t believe it .
How many times has Dad been married ?
- Four .
- Four ?
He never married my mother .
Yeah , he was already plotting the fifth .
I want to get married once ... ... just for my mom .
Is a husband too much for me to ask for ?
It' s too hot .
Even Angela Sands had a fiance .
Yeah .
Well , he probably cut her head off .
That' s sad .
- I' il see you later on , doc .
- Sure .
I' m gonna start opening up the machine .
Open her slightly , let some fluid out , and we' il catch it at the catch basin .
On three .
One , two , three .
I' m taking out the first article of clothing .
I' ve got --
It appears to be a woman' s left hand , and on it is ... ... a ring with a white stone in it .
Do me a favor .
Get a close- up of that .
It appears to be -- Possibly a serrated blade .
Come over here with me , and what I' d like to do is get another shot .
Over here , give me a close- up on that .
Thank you .
You got the close- up on the ring , correct ?
- Got it .
- Okay .
- We' re gonna start taking out ....
- Detective Malloy .
- Hi .
- Frannie , hey .
Hold on a second .
- I' m stepping out .
- All right , no problem .
Hey , where you been ?
I' ve been calling you all week .
You know , you' re supposed to look at some photos , remember ?
- I' ve been staying with Pauline .
- Yeah , where she' s staying ?
She has a place above the Baby Doll Lounge .
So ....
Hey , I must have called you like 10 times .
Do you think you can make it to the precinct tomorrow ?
It' s important .
Why ?
Well , another girl' s been murdered .
A med student .
Oh , no .
- What happened ?
- She was cut up .
Can' t find her head .
The fucking press is all over us .
It' s a megillah .
We' re all doing overtime .
Even the house mouses are on the street .
Do you think it' s the same guy who killed Angela Sands ?
If you' re asking me , yeah .
Oh , yeah .
- I' m getting out of here .
- I came to look for her .
- What time ?
- I don' t know .
Hold on a second .
I' m not gonna sleep tonight .
Do something for me , will you ?
- Are you standing ?
- Why ?
Are you alone ?
Where' s your sister ?
Sit down .
Are you sitting ?
Put your hand between your legs .
lnside your panties .
That pussy that I like .
And you slip your middle finger in .
It' s deep .
It' s soaking wet .
You run your finger up , and your clit' s right there .
It comes down to meet you .
It jumps in your hand .
When you touch a woman and her clit' s like that ... ... you know she knows about sex like you .
I gotta go .
It' s off in the distance
It came into the room It' s here in the circle
- Hold on one second .
Can I help you ?
- I' m here to see Detective Malloy .
- Malloy !
- Yeah .
- Your visitor' s out here , man .
- Who the hell ?
It' s my sister .
How you doing ?
Why don' t you take a hike .
- Yeah .
- You sleep all right ?
I missed you .
Come on .
Over here .
Look at this .
We got leaks in the ceiling .
They shoot down on us with . 22 caliber rifles from the rooftops .
Detective Rodriguez , you remember Miss ....
Avery .
Yeah , I know your name .
- Hey , how you doing ?
- Fine .
Thank you .
- Hey , you got anything on that ViCAP ?
- Nothing .
Detective Malloy .
Stand by , please .
Malloy .
- Malloy !
- Yeah .
I' m glad I got a chance to talk to you .
I want to apologize .
The other night , I was drunk .
I was out of line .
- I hope you didn' t get the wrong idea .
- No .
I didn' t get the wrong idea .
We' re square , then ?
Malloy wants me to look at pictures .
He said you' d have them .
Pictures ?
I was mugged the other night on West Broadway .
Oh , yeah , pictures .
No problem .
Who' s that ?
- Really ?
- I thought the guy was wearing a mask .
- You couldn' t see his face ?
- No , I couldn' t .
Why does Malloy want you to look at pictures ?
Perhaps I' il recognize somebody who was at the Red Turtle Bar .
That don' t mean shit .
- Hey Ritchie , what' s up ?
- What' s up , Halloran ?
How' s the diet ?
Hey , pato , kiss my ass .
I got those phone numbers .
It took me all fucking day .
You owe me bigtime .
Look through there .
lf he' s in there , he' il jump out at you .
You got a good memory ?
lf you see him , you gonna be able to pick him out ?
I don' t think that memory is very reliable .
Well , it better be .
You' re a school teacher , right ?
- People count on your memory .
- Detective Rodriguez bothering you ?
- Telling you about fish in the Hudson ?
- I was telling her about the time ... ... the cat ate the DOA' s balls on 1 23rd Street .
- That' s a good one .
- Malloy .
Malloy .
What am I , your maid or something ?
Your food is ready .
Your curry tofu .
I gotta get something to eat .
You hungry ?
You like calamari ?
- There' s this place on Arthur Ave -- - Ritchie .
When did you start liking white women ?
About the same time as you .
See you later .
Let' s get the fuck out of here .
This place is too fucking busy .
Come on .
Let' s go somewhere quiet .
How did you get to be a homicide detective so young ?
- Me ?
- Yeah .
- ln a word ?
- Yeah .
Compassion .
I took the desk no one else wanted .
What desk was that ?
The desk next to the holding cell .
You know , so I talked to the perps .
Gave them cigarettes , gum , so they start to trust you .
You know , start telling you things you want to know .
After a while , you pull down a big confession .
I got some bumps up .
Hey .
How long do you think ... ?
How long you suppose a woman needs to know a guy ... ... before she' il get engaged to him ?
- Shortest amount of time .
- Come on , Malloy .
- How long ?
- Oh , I don' t know .
I guess it depends .
- It took my mother about a half- hour .
- You' re kidding me ?
No .
What' d your father do ?
Romance her to fall in love ?
Put a gun to her head ?
- How' d that happen ?
- Yeah .
Yeah .
O what can ail thee , knight- at- arms Alone and palely loitering ?
The sedge has withered From the lake , and no birds sing
- What' s " sedge " ?
- Ferns .
This looks like a place where they dump bodies .
What' s in these bags ?
Garbage .
Go on , try it .
- No .
I' m frightened of guns .
- Why don' t you learn to use one .
Go on .
Go on .
How do you hold this thing ?
Do you -- ?
One hand or two ?
Hold it any way you want .
Just don' t hold it this way .
Again .
- You have to hold it with two hands .
- Yeah .
Try aiming this time .
Try .
Go on .
Try .
Cheap piece of shit .
Let' s see what good kissers we are .
- We already kissed .
- No , not really .
Come on , Miss lsthmus .
You used to do this when you were a kid ?
I went to boarding school .
You' re here for the sex , right ?
You don' t go nowhere with me , I didn' t fuck you .
Yeah , all right .
Would you get engaged to me ?
- ls this about the murder ?
- No .
Yeah , I can' t get the sick fuck out of my head .
- While we were kissing ?
- All the fucking time .
So do you want to stop by my place ?
Yeah .
I gotta tell you , I' m going away for a while .
Probably not gonna be able to talk to you for a little bit .
- Where are you going ?
- Florida .
It' s all paid for so I could have some time with my kids .
- ls your wife going ?
- My ex- wife ?
Yeah .
- No , your wife .
- Get the fuck out of here .
I sleep on the fucking couch .
All right ?
It' s complicated .
I didn' t have money to get an apartment ... ... so I went to live with my mother .
She' s worse than my wife .
Three years ago I moved back .
We don' t sleep together .
I moved back for my kids , okay ?
She can' t control my kids .
Do you ever tell the truth ?
Where you going ?
I' il give you a ride home .
Hey !
Something wrong ?
How did you get in ?
I hope you don' t mind .
I took a shower .
You know , you might want to check your messages .
That student of yours has been taken in for questioning .
The police found his term paper illustrated in blood .
That' s a little weird , isn' t it ?
You want some tea ?
I have to go out .
Actually , the real reason that I' m here is because ... ... I thought I should tell you that I' m gonna call Pauline and ask her out .
Really ?
Did I ever tell you that my mother ... ... used to dress me in girls ' blouses ?
Yes , I think you did .
- So do you think it' s a good idea ?
- What ?
About Pauline .
I think it' s a good idea , but , you know ....
Then again , I hardly know her at all .
I don' t think Pauline will sleep with you , if that' s what you' re thinking .
You' re right .
You' re right .
What -- ?
What am I thinking ?
She' s worse than you are .
Have sex with me ?
I must be out of my fucking mind .
Will you have sex with me ?
Shit !
I' m out of my fucking mind .
Will you have sex with me ?
Now
Thinking back on the course Of my passion
I was like one blind Unafraid of the dark
- Have you seen Pauline ?
- No .
- She hasn' t come in tonight ?
- No , she hasn' t , but ... ... just let me check , okay ?
Have you seen Pauline ?
No .
Myself , I hate to drink alone .
Pauline ?
Pauline ?
Are you alone ?
Frannie .
Frannie .
Frannie , it' s Malloy .
Hon , I gotta take that bag away from you .
I gotta take the bag .
Come on .
I know .
I know .
I gotta take it .
- Hey , Jackie .
- Yeah .
- Can you get her to 622 on 6th Street ?
- No problem .
I was at the morgue .
I' m sorry they made you wait .
I told them to let you go home .
I need to ask you some questions about Pauline , Frannie .
Let' s go .
When I was 13 ... ... my father left me in Geneva .
He was called away to Washington for five days .
He said later that it never occurred to him that I wouldn' t be all right .
Pauline said that I failed to take advantage of the situation .
That I should have ordered ... ... hundreds of boxes of chocolate , that I should have made a snowman .
- Was Pauline engaged ?
- No .
You recognize this ?
We found it on her left third finger .
No . ls that it ?
ls that his signature ?
Yeah , it' s his signature .
I want to know what happened .
I want to know if it was quick .
Why do you think knowing' s gonna make a difference , Frannie ?
- I thought that all my life .
- You' re wrong .
- Knowing don' t mean shit .
- " Doesn' t " mean shit .
This guy must have known her .
He strangled her ... ... till she lost consciousness , probably in the bedroom ... ... then dragged her into the bathroom and cut her throat .
Cut through the windpipe , the jugular , the epiglottis , the hyoid , the tongue .
He held her by her hair and cut all around .
This guy likes blood .
When he got to the vertebrae ... ... he needed a bigger knife to cut through that , and he had one .
He pulled the drain in the sinks before he left ... ... so he left us nothing that could help us .
It scares me that this guy knows about drains .
I' m gonna go back to the apartment .
There' s something I know , but I don' t know it yet .
- Sometimes it helps just to sit there -- - How will you get in ?
I got a key .
- You have a key ?
- Yeah .
You have her key ?
- I guess so .
I have a key .
- Did you kill her ?
Sgt. Lawrence , can you give Miss Avery a drive home ?
- Yes .
- Get the fuck out of here .
Who is it ?
Malloy ?
It' s me .
Cornelius .
I heard about your friend .
It' s all over the TV .
My sister .
Why are you wearing one shoe ?
The other shoe' s holding the door open , upstairs in my ....
You got a ....
You got a petal .
What happened ?
Fuck that man , all right .
- Fuck who ?
- Fuck him !
That cop .
- What cop ?
- Fuck him !
What cop ?
Malloy ?
You all right ?
I don' t ....
I don' t want to do this .
Why ?
You don' t like it ?
No , I like it .
I like it .
I just don' t want to do this .
I' m drunk .
I didn' t want to fuck you anyways .
What you want , huh ?
- What , girl ?
- Let me go .
- What ?
- Let me go .
You been looking to fuck my head up since day one !
- You' ve been looking to fuck with me .
- Cornelius .
You don' t know me , man .
- What ?
- Malloy wanted me to check .
- Make sure you got home all right .
- Where is he ?
You okay ?
- You tell him not to bother me .
- Sure .
Frannie , it' s Malloy .
Open the door .
Frannie !
Frannie , open the door .
Frannie , come on , wake up .
Open the door .
Frannie !
Frannie , come on !
You look all right to me .
Ritchie said you were screaming half- naked out the window .
- You were a long time .
- Yeah , I was working .
Getting a blowjob ?
lsn' t that your line of work ?
What is it ?
No such thing as a bad blowjob .
Well , you' re wrong there .
Some women give terrible blowjobs .
No rhythm at all .
No sense of cock whatsoever .
Good phrase , " no sense of cock . "
Yes , that must be terrible .
Frannie , we got a problem here .
I' m standing in your sister' s apartment , trying to put this case together .
I can' t .
You want to know why ?
I' m worrying about you .
Let' s get you cleaned up , come on .
Give you a bath .
Let' s go .
Good cop .
I' m a good detective .
It' s the only thing I' m good at .
I' m not good at this .
Want me to go , I' il go .
Want me to stay , I' il stay .
Gotta want something .
You' re smarter than me .
I' m running to keep up .
- I' m scared of what I want .
- Why ? ls it a lot ?
Yeah , it' s a lot .
That' s the problem with women .
You can never be satisfied .
I' m sorry .
- Why ?
You didn' t do nothing .
- I' m sorry you feel that way .
Your problem is , you' re fucking exhausting .
Fuck this .
I was doing just fine before I met you .
Just fine .
What' s this ?
You' il see .
- Will I like it ?
- I don' t know .
I think so .
You' re not sure .
You' re not sure .
- You think I' m obsessed with you ?
- Maybe .
No .
No .
No .
Go on , fuck yourself .
I wanna watch you fuck yourself .
- Go on .
- You like to watch ?
Yeah , I like it in the cut .
That' s it .
Fuck yourself .
That' s it .
Go on .
You' re so beautiful . lf I keep looking at you , I' il have to quit being a cop .
Frannie .
Oh , Frannie .
All right .
Get me out of these things .
Get me out of this .
Makes me very nervous , being in handcuffs .
Hurry up !
I' m starting to fucking feel like a chick here .
- Get over there .
- Where is it ?
ln my jacket pocket .
Hurry up .
Hurry up .
Yeah .
lnside left pocket .
Hurry up !
Oh , yeah .
- The charm from my bracelet .
- I meant to give it to you .
I forgot .
Where did you get this ?
On West Broadway .
I went back there the same night ... ... to see if I had missed something , and I found it .
It was you .
What the fuck is the matter with you ?
I saw you .
I saw your tattoo .
I never thought that you killed her .
I just never thought that .
Frannie , get me out of these fucking things now !
Enough of this shit , Frannie .
Give me the key .
Get me out of here .
I' m not kidding , Frannie .
Get me out of this fucking thing .
Unlock these fucking things now !
Give me the fucking keys !
Mother --
Damn it !
Fuck !
Get your fucking ass out the goddamn street , bitch !
Whoa !
- Are you okay ?
- ls she all right ?
She' s fine .
Thanks , Dad .
Take it easy .
- I didn' t know .
- Take it easy .
I can' t go with you , because he' il know .
- What ?
- He killed Pauline .
- Who ?
- Malloy .
I saw him with Angela Sands .
I saw his tattoo .
I saw the three of spades .
Jesus .
We' d better talk about this .
- We' il go someplace .
- I can' t go to the police .
- You tell me what happened .
- Frannie !
- Did he hurt you ?
- No .
Frannie !
Fuck !
Fuck !
No !
Where are we going ?
To the lighthouse .
You ever been there ?
To the Lighthouse .
I teach that book .
Yeah ?
I fish there .
Look at the G. W.
That' s something .
It' s my little fishing lodge .
Wanna see inside ?
Yeah , me and Malloy , we got them together after our first big bust .
He' s a good cop .
Best partner I ever had .
You want wine ?
I got wine .
I' m gonna have to leave you here a couple of days .
I' m sorry .
People saw us together on the street .
You wanna hang up his jacket ?
Are you cold ?
Don' t cry .
Hey , hey .
Don' t cry .
Don' t cry .
You ever been in love ?
See , I met this girl .
I' ve been thinking about her my whole life .
You know , dreaming about her .
But the thing is ... ... I don' t know if she loves me .
I mean , all women want love , right ?
What about you ?
You want love ?
Wanna be kissed ?
My guess is , you want it so bad it hurts .
I' m right .
Will you marry me , Frannie ?
Put on the ring .
Put on the fucking --
Jesus- fucking- Christ !
What are you , crazy ?
