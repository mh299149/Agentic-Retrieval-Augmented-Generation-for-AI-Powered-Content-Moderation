- [Prison] Previously on Prison Break .
We' re through the hard part .
Another 18 inches , we' il hit that pipe .
We' il be there by Friday .
Now we got a hell of a lot to talk about , don' t we ?
This guy says he' s on the job in here .
Concrete is my specialty .
Okay , boss , sign him up .
Whites don' t want you , blacks don' t want you .
You' re just caught in the middle , aren' t you ?
A regular ' tweener .
- Hello .
- It' s me .
- It' s time .
- Yes .
Why are you so cynical ?
Michael , I think there' s cynicism and then there' s realism .
There' s optimism , hope , faith .
Thank you for trying to make me smile -- not today .
You never know .
You want the Cooper story ?
I can' t give it to you , ' cause I' m not him .
The lawyers you tried to blow up , they' re still running around .
Same thing goes with the kid .
You got to hand the reins over to me , now .
First of all ...
Ow !
You and your partner are off the job until further notice .
That one .
- Nice choice .
- Thanks .
Platinum .
Brushed .
- Six point two five ?
- Six point two five .
She' s a lucky woman .
Yes .
She is .
You kept it .
Kept what ?
The flower .
I' m a pack rat , I never throw anything out .
Yeah , all this clutter , it' s , uh ... overwhelming .
You should see my apartment .
Haven' t even had our first date yet , and already you' re inviting me in .
Thought you were a nice girl .
Oh , Michael , we all know nice girls finish last .
So where do you finish ?
That depends on where I start .
Deep breath .
Exhale .
Inhale .
Sara , we' re backing up out here .
Right .
I' m sorry .
I' m going to get your shot .
This is not what I signed on for .
What do you want us to do ?
Want us to wave the white flag ?
Call a time out ?
I just want to get Lincoln off death row .
Lincoln ?
We just learned that Vice President Reynolds funneled millions of dollars in research grants into her brother' s company .
That money was filtered into millions of small accounts , that made millions of small donations to her campaign , setting her up to be the next leader of the free world .
This doesn' t end with us stopping an execution anymore .
For me , it does .
Okay .
Let' s rotate .
Sergeant Sodomy , you' re up next .
Yo .
Come on .
I don' t know about you all , but , uh ... this room is getting a little too dark for me to dig .
You telling me that there' s a hole in Fox River that you don' t want to get into ?
What ?
Hey , no one gets hurt .
You know , I got a question .
How come Fusilli over here ain' t grabbing a shovel ?
I' m handling arrangements on the outside .
Really ?
So what is that transpo ?
Paper ?
Exactly .
That makes me management .
And that makes us just labor .
Mm- hmm .
Now you' re getting it .
You know , management better keep a close eye on the conditions up in here .
Or the labor' s liable to go on strike .
You feel me ?
Get back to work .
Whoa , whoa .
CO' s coming .
Put that back up there .
Scofield .
Move it .
It' s time for your conjugal .
Your wife is here .
So you' re Mrs. Scofield .
You ever done this before ?
Had a conjugal , I mean .
No .
Don' t worry , I' m just trying to make conversation .
Clear .
She look familiar to you ?
Mm .
No , Captain .
I know her from somewhere .
You came .
Of course .
How have you been ?
Fine .
I found a job .
Good .
I' m glad .
Is it awful being here ?
Remember the first place you stayed ?
That hotel by the airport ?
Only difference is $69 and the free shampoo .
Always the brave face .
You' re still wearing it .
Every day .
I worry about you .
Don' t .
Is there anything else that I can do ?
Just what we agreed on .
I was so nervous when they were checking .
One question .
Why would you need a credit card in prison ?
See , I don' t think the riot changed anything .
Have you seen the latest budget cuts for this place ?
Another ten percent from health care .
35 % from prevention .
He might be the governor , but he' s also your father .
Maybe he thinks if he cuts enough they can' t afford you .
You understand this is standard procedure following a conjugal , Scofield ?
Never can be too careful .
All right , bend over .
You have a good time in the romper room with that Euro ?
Whatever you say , boss .
She come around here before ?
- First time .
- You sure ?
' Cause damn if I don' t recognize her from somewhere .
Maybe she visits some other con .
Killing two birds with one bone .
- Catching my drift ?
- I wouldn' t know .
All right .
He' s clear , Captain .
Make sure you take a shower , Scofield .
You never know what some women can give you .
Swing low
Sweet chariot
Coming for to carry me home
Swing low
You know this one , don' t you ?
Sweet chariot
Coming for to carry me home .
Come on , give me something .
I thought you was the musical people .
You know , parents must be so proud of you , man .
I mean , hitting the trailer park trifecta .
Racist ... pedophile , and stupid .
You know , it vexes me that ... that I' m made out to be the bad guy in the room .
It' s not like y' all are incarcerated for stealing Girl Scout cookies .
None of us murdered any Girl Scouts in the process .
Michael' s coming back from the bone yard .
Alone ... alone .
I tell you everything about me and Maricruz , and you can' t even tell me you' re married ?
Later .
Rough day , huh , Scofield ?
While the rest of us are in here slinging concrete , you got some little girl to play on your rusty trombone , huh ?
The man' s got a point .
Just doesn' t seem equitable- like .
You know what I' m saying ?
Shut up and dig , T- Bag .
I think what the idiots inside here wants to know is ... while we' re digging this hole ... what are you doing ?
I' m going shopping .
We' re good .
All clear .
A credit card ?
The bulls catch you with that , they' il be so far up your doggy door , you' il ...
Don' t worry .
They won' t be catching me with one .
- How you so sure ?
- Because ...
I don' t have a credit card .
Nick ?
Help !
Please !
I had an accident ... my car ... is totaled .
I just need ... please ... is anyone in there ?
We can' t just ignore him .
The hell we can' t .
Please !
Help me , please !
Oh , God .
What happened ?
Uh ...
I must have dozed off .
I was driving for 12 hours .
Should I get some water from the well ?
- The well' s dried up .
- Oh , God , my leg .
I think there' s a medical kit over here .
No one' s going anywhere .
All right .
Say good- bye to junior .
No !
You know how many pints of blood the human body has ?
The answer is ten .
Ten pints .
How many do you think Prince Charming over there on the floor has left ?
Eight ?
Going on seven ?
Tell you what -- I' m gonna take him out to the woodshed , have a little talk .
In the meantime , I want you to chew on this .
You tell me everything that you have discovered about the Burrows case , and who else you' ve told about it , and there' s a chance that I might let you go in time to get Mr. Savrinn to a doctor .
You decide whose life is more valuable -- the guy waiting to die on death row or the guy wishing he' d die out in the woodshed .
One suit , black .
One pair of socks , black .
One pair of shoes .
Shoelaces .
One small tape recorder .
One gold watch .
You ever stay at a fancy hotel , LJ ?
You know , you leave your room in the morning , it' s a mess .
Wet , dirty towels on the bathroom floor ,
last night' s room service stinking to high heaven .
But then , when you come back at night , it' s all gone .
Fresh towels , clean sheets , candy on the pillow .
It' s just the best feeling in the whole world ,
' cause someone else cleaned up your mess , all you had to do was walk away .
Don' t you hurt them .
Okay .
But you got to tell me exactly what they know and who else they have told , and nobody has to die tonight .
You just walk away .
Let me clean up your mess .
I don' t know what' s going on .
I swear to God !
I wish I could believe that .
Bellick assigned me a new cell mate .
Who' d you get ?
Some new fish .
Ran a bump and swipe on an off- duty cop .
Fast hands , faster mouth .
Yo , what' s crackin ' , my peoples ?
Speak of the devil .
Michael Scofield .
David Apolskis .
What' s up ?
I seen you before , right ?
You' re part of that PI crew .
Maybe you could hook me up .
You know , a brother needs to make some green -- some cash- eesh , you know what I' m sayin ' ?
It pays 19 cents an hour .
19 cents ?
That' s slavery , yo .
That' s prison , yo .
And besides , Pl' s all full up for now .
All right .
I feel you .
But keep a brother in mind , all right , if something opens up , you know ?
Hell , I' il pay 19 cents an hour to get me some more time out the block .
Like having another kid .
Already raised one , I' m too old to do it again .
You ever hear of anything being stolen from R and D ?
Of course .
Bulls steal from personals all the time .
The problem is , you never know what' s gone until you' re on the outside of the walls .
At that point , you can' t do anything about it .
What if you knew now ?
Look , I told you , leave me out of whatever it is you got going .
I just need to know if you' ve seen a guard with a gold watch .
There' s a lot of people that can get you a gold watch in here .
Yeah , but I need this specific gold watch .
Westmoreland !
Pope wants to see you !
Let' s go !
Look , I haven' t seen nothing .
But there is this one CO -- word is , he' s the worst thief in here .
My wife just faxed this over for you from county records .
Copy of Scofield' s marriage license .
She says you owe her big time .
Looks legit .
He wasn' t trying to sneak in some whore for a conjugal .
Says here , they got married the day before Scofield robbed that bank .
Why the hell would he do that ?
- Heard from Veronica ?
- No .
You ?
Just a note from LJ saying he' s with her , that he was safe .
But , you know , it' s been awhile .
Doesn' t feel right .
Feels wrong .
Really wrong .
I , uh ...
I' ve come to a realization .
Either Miss Donovan and that boy don' t like you very much or they have an unreasonable amount of faith in your cardiovascular system .
So tell me , Nick , this all you got ?
This paper trail of an indictment that never even happened ?
Is this it ?
We know you don' t have a surveillance tape anymore .
We know you don' t have anybody to testify .
So is this really all you' ve got ?
Mr. Savrinn , that bullet went through your teres major , ripped the lateral margin of your scapula ,
leaving you absolutely no medial rotation of your arm .
So , if you try to swing that piece of lumber at me ... ... it' s gonna feel like your arm is ripping out of its socket .
Come on , Nick .
Mr. Project Justice .
We both know why you' re really here , don' t we ?
And it ain' t to save Lincoln Burrows ' life .
Inside these walls , I creep and I crawl , looking for a way out .
But I know it' s gonna be no easy route .
This is gonna be a 12 round ... 12 round bout .
With Bellick and T- Bag on my mind ... ... it' s grindin ' here ...
Still interested in getting in on Pl ?
Does my mama got big breastices ?
I wouldn' t know .
Hell , yeah , she does , and hell , yeah , I do .
All right , look , I need a favor .
Word is , you made your trade as a snatch and grab .
That' s right .
I need you to steal something back that was stolen from me .
What kind of somethin ' we talkin ' about ?
Just a watch .
Uh- uh , there ain' t no such thing as " just a watch . "
Every design has a different clasp , every clasp has a different swipe .
It' s Italian , a Remedi .
Gold band , pearl face , all- weather .
- What year ?
- 2003 .
There' s a butterfly clasp on that bitch .
- Which means what ?
- Hidden deployment .
There ain' t no way to snatch it without the mark feeling it -- which just means I' m gonna have to get whimsical on this ficky .
I get you this watch , that mean I get in on some of that Pl ?
It means I' il think about it -- no promises .
Why you need this watch so bad anyway ?
Let' s just say it means a lot to someone in my family .
Come in , Charles .
Sit down .
What' s going on ?
I' ve got some bad news , Charles .
Your daughter is very sick .
She' s got esophageal cancer .
Now , she' s at Sacred Heart in Indianapolis .
And she wants to see you while there' s still time .
How much time ?
Doctors say a few weeks .
The problem is , the D. O. C. is not gonna let you go .
They think you' re still a flight risk .
- She' s my only child .
- I know that .
Believe me , Charles , I' ve lobbied on your behalf .
It' s state policy .
They will only extend furloughs in the case of funerals .
You' re telling me
I have to wait until she dies before I see her ?
Mr. Scofield , looks like I' il be administering your shot today .
Where' s Dr. Tancredi ?
We' ve got a busy schedule today .
She' s with another patient .
Hold him down before he jumps off the cart !
Hold his legs !
Hold his legs down !
Hey , we need a doctor here !
All right .
What' s happened ?
I don' t know .
The kid was in chow .
Then all of sudden , he collapsed , and he started spittin ' up his food .
Looks like he' s having some kind of a seizure .
Get him up here , get him up here .
And make sure he doesn' t hurt himself .
I gonna O2 and a cardio ...
Hold him , hold him !
So , Ms. Donovan , how is that background in real estate law going for you ?
It' s a big help ?
Hmm ?
You know , frankly , I think we caught a break .
Lincoln had nailed a girl with half a brain , she probably would have brought this whole thing down already .
But you know what the worst part is ?
That you dragged these people into this , knowing that you had no clue how to get them out .
I mean , if you had just minded your own business , people like Leticia Barris -- she wouldn' t have a mouthful of maggots right about now .
Your fiancé would not be lying in his apartment waiting for the smell of his rotting corpse to let the neighbors know that something had gone horribly wrong .
That' s right -- their deaths are on your head .
You made this mess .
Nobody else .
You .
But you' re also the one person that can end it all right here .
All I need to know is who else you' ve involved .
So , you just nod , and I' il know you' re ready to talk .
You know , Ms.
Donovan , I think that , uh , you look a little cold .
Maybe you' il find it easier to talk ... after you' ve warmed up a little bit .
Where is he ?
What happened ?
We got to move .
Come on , we don' t have time .
Come on !
Come on , we' re getting out of here .
Where are the keys ?
My pocket .
Start the car !
Okay .
Is he gonna be all right ?
Go start the car , LJ !
We' re gonna get you to a hospital , all right ?
A gift from my cell mate .
Thank you .
And thank him .
The watch -- what' s it for anyway ?
Thought you didn' t want to know about any of this .
Things have changed .
I want in .
Why the sudden change of heart ?
I have my reasons .
Don' t take this the wrong way , but everyone who' s in is bringing something to the table .
How about money ?
- How much we talking about ?
- I think you know .
I seem to remember several conversations that ended with , " I am not D. B. Cooper . "
- I lied .
- You lied ?
We' re cons .
We tend to do that .
I checked your alibi .
According to records , you were incarcerated at the time of the Cooper hijacking .
My father and I share more than just a weakness for easy money .
We also share a name .
Charles Westmoreland , Senior was the one locked up that day .
Now , do you want the money or not ?
No offense , but it' s a little convenient .
You want in , and suddenly , you' re the guy .
How do I know you' re not lying right now ?
Hey , Old Man River , keep it moving .
Hey , Sucre ...
I got a question about you and the rest of the Mexicans .
I don' t think I' il be able to help , seeing as I' m Puerto Rican .
Geographical semantics , amigo .
I' m speaking about the general " Latin- o " population .
How is it that a people so historically
lazy ended up being such a big part of the nation' s work force ?
The way I see things , it' s everyone else that' s lazy .
Otherwise , there wouldn' t be any jobs for the immigrants .
The ones sitting at home collecting unemployment , the lazy ones -- it' s not us .
You gonna let him talk about your people like that ?
Uh , whatever , Deliverance .
You know what ?
We may be a team in here , but just so that you know , the minute we get over that wall , it' s every man for himself .
Or sooner .
LJ ?
LJ ?
LJ ?
Do you know how the Russians do things ?
They let you live , and they kill everyone else in your family , and , well , any- anyone you' ve ever loved .
How does that sound ?
- Go to hell .
- Oh , come on .
Is that any way for a lady to talk ?
Oh .
What , do you think I' m an idiot ?
I' m just going to walk into a well ?
Seriously , Ms. Donovan .
You all right ?
Scofield , no sitting down on the job .
I want you out here working where I can see you .
I' m on it , boss .
Move it , Scofield .
Move it !
Hey , Brad .
Good to see you .
Hey , baby .
All right , ladies and gentlemen , put your hands together for our next lovely young lady .
Up on the main stage , it' s Jasmine .
Would you like a private dance ?
Why don' t you sit down and chat for awhile .
See if we hit it off .
- So , what' s your name ?
- Brad .
- Yours ?
- Jasmine .
Come on ... your real name .
- It' s Nika .
- Nika .
Now that' s a pretty name .
Tell me , Nika , how' s your husband feel about you working here ?
I' m not married .
I hope you' re lying for the sake of titillation .
Otherwise , your little visit to Fox River this morning would have been breaking the law ...
Mrs. Scofield .
We are married .
But they tell all the girls to lie .
It' s better for making business .
I' m not here to get you in trouble .
I just want to know a little more about your husband .
Well , he' s a very good man .
I' m sure he is .
But even good men do bad things .
Your accent .
You' re from -- now , don' t tell me -- Budapest , right ?
- Prague .
- Prague ...
How recently did you come over ?
Only a couple months , I bet .
You like it here in America ?
You know , I really have to keep moving .
They don' t like us to spend too much time in one spot .
Now I don' t want to have to check into your immigration status ...
I just need to know what Michael Scofield wanted from you in exchange for the green card .
Nothing .
We met while he was studying overseas ...
I don' t want to know what you memorized for the INS .
Now , either you answer my questions about Scofield , or I call my guy in the Chicago P. D.
And maybe he starts asking some questions about you .
A credit card .
He asked me to bring him a credit card .
That' s it .
Yeah .
Trace this call .
Come and get me -- now .
New Glarus , I' m in New Glarus .
No , thanks , I brought my own .
Dorothy Andrews Elston Kabis .
United States Treasurer , 1971 .
The year of the D. B. Cooper hijacking .
Dl192589 -- the first number in a series of bills used in the ransom drop .
Thanks for the history lesson .
All it proves is you did the research .
Same as me .
So , you' re married .
Uh , well ... not in the traditional sense of the word .
Michael , we' re both adults , put your cards on the table .
Okay , I' il got first .
Um ... as one of the very few women around here ,
I' m used to a certain amount of innuendo and flirtation being thrown my way .
I' m not used to enjoying it .
Look , Sara ...
It' s " Dr.
Tancredi , " and please let me finish .
I' m not a jealous woman .
But I am a careful one .
And for some reason , when I' m around you , I' m not .
Careful .
- You don' t have to be .
- Yes , I do .
There are so many questions surrounding you , Michael .
There are way too many .
So here' s the deal .
Um ...
From now on , your shots , any medical concerns , they' re all fine , as long as it' s doctor- patient .
But personal questions and favors of any kind , are no longer a part of our relationship .
The questions you have about me ... there are answers .
Quinn !
I was getting worried .
You guys get lost ?
We tried to call you again to pinpoint your signal , but you never picked up .
Yeah , the battery went dead on the damn cell phone .
What are you going to do , right ?
So , uh , how' d it go ?
I have a broken leg down here .
Yeah , listen , you know , I think maybe we got off on the wrong foot .
You have bosses , I have bosses . but at the end of the day , we' re all on the same team .
Right ?
We' re both just trying to tie up some loose ends .
I could not agree more .
Yeah , so , can you guys get a rope or a ladder , or something ?
What the hell is that ?
Hey ...
Hey !
Just tying up some loose ends .
You stupid son of ...
Hey , guys !
Hey !
Hey , don' t do this !
Don' t do this !
Please !
My leg' s broken , I can' t stand !
You have to help me !
You can' t just leave him down there .
He' il die .
He' s the only one who knows we don' t have the Burrows kid .
The only one .
There' s room for you down there too , Danny .
Don' t leave me like this !
Don' t leave me !
Please !
Please !
You coming back to PI today ?
It' s getting kind of testy in there , you know ?
Yeah .
I just needed to find something out .
What the hell is that ?
Listen .
Am I supposed to be hearing something ?
Shh .
Just hold on .
- There .
- What ?
We sat around here for 20 minutes waiting to hear that ?
18 minutes , actually .
And , yes .
- What was it ?
- Keys .
The guards ' keys .
18 minutes is how long we have between each time the guards pass beneath the infirmary windows on their rounds at night .
Cons aren' t allowed outside after hours .
It was the only way I could find out the timing .
- What does that mean ?
- It means ...
Four days from now , on the night of the escape , we' il have 18 minutes to get the bars off the infirmary window , and for all seven of us to get across the wire and over the wall .
- Is that doable ?
- Of course .
What' s up ?
Nothing .
Hey , I know that look .
What' s up ?
I hit it !
I hit it !
There it is , the pipe !
We' re there !
Guys , guys .
Come on , Michael , talk to me .
You want the good news or the bad ?
The good .
Westmoreland and his money are in .
- What' s the bad ?
- I' ve done the math .
It' il take at least 5 minutes for us to get the bars off the window in the infirmary .
And two minutes each for us to get across the wire and over the wall .
So ?
We' ve only got 18 minutes .
We' ve got too many people .
One of them has to go .
