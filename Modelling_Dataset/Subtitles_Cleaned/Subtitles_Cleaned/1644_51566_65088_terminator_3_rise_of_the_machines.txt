- [...] The future ... has not been written .
There is no fate for what we make us for ourselves .
I wish I could believe that .
My name is John Connor .
They tried to murder me , before I was born .
When I was 13 , they tried again .
Machines from the future ...
Terminators ...
All my life ... my mother told me the strom was coming .
Judgement Day .
The beginning of war between men and machines .
3 billion lives will vanish in a instance .
I would lead the war with the rest of human race and alternate victory .
It hasn' t happended .
No bombs fell .
Computers didn' t take control ...
We stopped Judgement Day .
I should feel safe .
But , I don' t .
So , I live off the grid .
No phone ...
No address ...
No one ... and nothing can find me .
I' d erased all connections to the past .
But , as hard I tried ...
I can' t erase my dreams .
My nightmares ...
I feel the weight of the future bearing down on me .
A future I don' t want ...
So , I keep running .
As fast as I can ...
Anywhere ...
Nowhere ...
BEVERLY HlLLS
Oh my god !
Are you OK ?
Show me call you 911 ?
I like this car .
Wait !

For her and I mean ...
Your confusion is unaddressional .
She is a healthy female and a breeding ages .
Take these or more ... to it or not ?
My database has nothing composed of Dynamics of Human Fear Banding .
So .. was ...
Terminatrix ... how many others does she have in her list ?
22 !
Anderson Elizabeth .
Anderson William .
Barrera Jose .
Brewster Robert .
My father ?
Having fail to acquire his primary target ...
TX will resume his T4 program .
She' s gonna kill my father , too ?
This is a high properliaty .
No !
Who is he ?
What does he do ?
He ...
He' s in the Air Force .
Weapon Design ...
Secret Staff !
I don' t ...
I don' t know it exactly ...
General Robert Brewster is the program director of C. R. S.
Cyber Research Systems ...
A Dyna Weapons Decison .
SkyNet
You' re talking about SkyNet , Aren' t you ?
SkyNet is the one of the Digital Defence Systems develped by Brewster' s supervision .
Oh ...
God !
Oh ... my God !
Of course !
Oh !
My sense now ...
If you wouldn' t come back when I was a kid ...
Is ...
Everything hadn' t changed ...
She and I will have to got together , then ...
So , I' d met your father long time ago .
Don' t you see ?
I ...
I don' t understand that ...
Your father ...
This is all about your father .
He is the key .
He always was ...
Your father is one who can shut SkyNet down .
You see only one who ever could .
We have to get to him further T- X does .
Negative .
I can' t drop on my mission .
This is your mission !
To save people !
My mission is to ensure the survival of John Connor and Catherine Brewster .
I ...
I' m giving you an order !
I' m not programmed to follow your orders !
After the nuclear war , we have to leave .
- Nuclear war ?
- That doesn' t have to be a war !
We can stop it !
It' s an insufficient time .
The first launch sequences will be initiated at 6 : 18 PM .
What ...
Today ?
- Affirmative !
- John , What is he saying ?
Judgement Day ...
An end of the world .
It' s today ... 3 hours from now .
2 Hours and 53 Minutes .
We must continue to South and Mexico .
Escape to the primary plascell' s zone .
Ooh ...
But , we have to get to her dad .
The Mohalli area was sustained its significant nuclear fallout .
You will not survive .
You mean ... we may just go run and hide somewhere in a hole or other ... bombs fall ?
It is your destiny .
- Fuck my destiny .
- John !
You can not self terminate .
No .
You can' t .
I can do whatever the hell I wanna do .
I' m an human being .
I' m not the god damn robot .
- Cyborgnetic organism - Whatever !
Either , we go to her father ...
We get him to shut SkyNet down .
Stop the ship from whatever happening .
Or ... so much for the great John Connor .
' Cause , your future , my destiny ...
I don' t want any part of it .
I never did .
Based to your pupil dialation ... skin temperature , motor functions ... are calculated 83 % properbility ... did you will not trigger .
Please ...
Please do it as he said !
You have to save my father !
We can reach CRS in approximately 1 hour ... depending on traffic conditions .
I ...
I can' t get on- line .
The whole works are down .
SkyNet is summoning control of global communications and prepration for its attack .
So ... this war is between people and machines ... ?
Why are you on our side ?
The Resistance captured me . and reprogrammed my CPU .
I was originally designed for assasination missions .
So ...
You don' t really care for this mission successes or not .
If we get killed ... does that mean anything to you ?
If you would die ...
I' il become useless .... don' t be no reason for me to exist .
Thank you for doing this .
Your gratute aptitude does not be required .
I' m programmed to follow your commands .
Her commands ?
It was Catherine Brewster who had reactivated me and sent through time and space field .
What is exactly am I in the future of yours ?
You' re John Connor' s spouse and second in Command .
Oh ...
No !
What ?
You' re a mass !
Yeah ! you' re not exactly my type , either .
So , why didn' t I send you back ?
I' m not authorized to answer your question .
Why didn' t he send you back ?
He was dead .
Ooh ...
It well sucks ...
Humans inevitably die .
Yeah ...
I know .
So ... how was it ?
No ... maybe I ...
I don' t wanna know ...
How does he die ?
John Conner was terminated at July , 4th , 2032 .
I was selected for the emotional touchment he develped his modern number to do these boys of experiences .
This aided ... it a mastration ...
What ?
What are you saying ?
I killed you .
It has to be mistake .
Until 11 : 00 , all primary military systems were secured .
They were !
Only survailant sectors were infected .
Internet , Air traffic , Power plant ...
That' s all everything .
Then , a few minutes ago , we' ve got the guidance computer bannable crash .
We gotta be communication error .
But , not it looks like a virus .
Early morning , Alaska was down .
- What ?
- Signal from hampers and satellite was scrambled and beyond ignitions .
What about the Missile silos and subs ?
We lost contacts .
Do you got ...
Did you say this is completely open to attack ?
Theoretically , we can be under attack already .
Who' s doing this ?
Some power or some computer hackering garage ...
We can' t trace a virus and we can' t pan it down .
Some ... somebody he is we' ve never seen before It keeps growing and changing .
And , It' s like an mind of its own .
This can' t be happening .
Sir ! the Pentagon is on the secure line .
That' s a Chairman .
Right .
Look ...
None is gonna happen .
OK ?
We can get to your dad ... and we can unplug the SkyNet ...
Bomb won' t fall .
You won' t have to kill me someday ... will never gonna exist ...
You and I become ... go to the separate ways .
You know ...
Mike Crypy' s basement .
How' s first on my first kissed guy .
Really ?
You' il never be good ... if relief intention in the fear of death .
Brewser !
Well ... what' s the hell you got the kind of solution for this ?
I know what you' re looking forward ... , Sir !
But , SkyNet is not ready for this system wide connection .
That sounds a discovery on a kind of approximity over there which they just told me .
They say we didn' t stop this stand by the virus .
Now , I have a scanned certain out of performance and anxiety on you over there .
But , your boys are saying we will plug the SkyNet into all my systems .
And , it' il squash this thing like a bug .
And , Give me my back control of my military !
Mr. Chairman !
I need myself very clear .
If we are uplink now , SkyNet will control your military .
But , you' re in good at control of SkyNet !
Right ?
That is correct , Sir !
Then , do it !
And , Brewster !
If your thing works ... you' il get over fundings you ever need .
Yes , Sir !
EXECUTE Y/ N ? _
Sir ?
Shall we ?
No .
It' s my job , now .
SKYNET DEFENCE SYSTEM NOW ACTlVATED .
We are in !
Passed the firewalls and local defence net in a minimum subs .
SkyNet is holding up Rational Processing at 60 TerraBlop per sec .
Sir !
She should take less than a minute and find the virus program .
Must pretty god this works .
SKYNET DEFENCE SYSTEM NOW ACTlVATED .
PLEASE ...
Power failure ?
No .
Tony , What the hell is going now ?
Daddy !
Kate !
What are you doing here ?
Daddy !
Get away from him !
Watch out !
Daddy ! ...
Daddy !
Don' t move !
She' il be back !
We should shut down Skynet !
Where is the system core ?
Somewhere in this building ?
SkyNet !
The virus has defected SkyNet .
SkyNet is the virus !
It' s the reason everything' s falling apart !
SkyNet has become himeself weird .
In 1 hour , it will initiate a massive nuclear attack on this enemy .
What enemy ?
Us !
Humans !
Oh ...
God !
This machine' s started to take over .
My office ... on this for us we do ...
The access codes are in my safe .
Why are they killing everyone ?
It destroyes any possible threat to SkyNet .
Which ...

The day the human race has been really destoyed by the weapons they' d protect himself .
I should' ve realized .
Our destiny was never to stop Judgement Day .
Because , we knew it we will survival it .
Together ...
The terminator knew it .
He tried to tell us .
But , I didn' t want to hear it .
Maybe , the future has been written .
I don' t know .
All I know is what the Terminator taught me .
Never to stop fighting .
And , I never will .
Battle was ... just began .
