What' s up , Winston ?
Hey , Don .
Listen .
I can' t seem to access this site .
I- I need your computer expertise .
Yeah ?
What is it ?
It' s like a whole system for breaking down the plots of detective fiction ... or the solution of crimes .
Y - Click .
Yes .
You see ?
And click .
I tried before .
Stay calm .
Click .
Uh -
[ Chuckles ]
Go get ' em , Sherlock .
Cool , cool , cool .
Oh , this is my kind of information , man .
I love the Net .

You sure you don' t want a computer at your house ?
No .
Seems awful strange to me .
A man who made all of his money off of computers doesn' t want to have one in his house .
Oh !
Cool .
Cool .
This is fascinating .
Supposedly , you can use this to write a mystery novel ... or to solve a complicated crime .
If -
Don .
You all right ?
What ?
Is something wrong ?
Well , it' s probably nothing .
Uh , a love letter from one of your lovely ladies .
Something like that .
I' il read it to you .
" Dear Don , sometimes life brings some strange surprises .
" It' s been almost 20 years since we' ve seen each other ,
" but now there' s something I need to tell you .
" Years ago , after our story ended ,
" I discovered I was pregnant .
" I decided to go through with the pregnancy , and I had a baby , a son .
" Your son .
" I decided to raise him by myself because our time together ...
" had come to a close .
" My son is now almost 19 .
" He' s somewhat shy and secretive , unlike you ,
" but a sensitive , wonderful person .
" A few days ago he left on a mysterious road trip ,
" but I' m almost certain he' s searching for his father .
" I' ve told him almost nothing about you ,
" but he' s resourceful and imaginative .
" Anyway , if this is , in fact , your correct address , well , I just felt I should let you know . "
There' s no signature ... and no return address .
Hey , congratulations !
You' re a father .
Uh , you' re really upset by this .
C- Can I see it ?
Your address is handwritten , but printed .
Red ink on pink paper .
Typewriter .
<i>A red ribbon .
Curious . </ i>
" Dear Don , sometimes " -
Hmm .
Damn .
This postmark is too faint to read .
That' s fucked up .
Tsk- tsk .
[ Chuckles ]
And you have no idea who this is from ?
Nope .
None .
But from all I know , you are like , uh - like Don Juan or something .
[ Chuckling ]
Don Juan .
[ Muttering ]
I gotta go .
You want me to keep the letter for forensic evidence or ... clues ?
Or - Don .

<i>[ Volume Down ] </ i>
Is Sherry coming home ?
No .
She left .
<i>What do you mean , " She left ' " ? </ i>
<i>She went on a trip ? </ i>
No .
I mean , she left .
Sorry , man .
Yeah , me too .
I think .
Well , but knowing Sherry , she probably hasn' t played her last card yet .
Right ?
Probably not .
Anyway , you' ve never had trouble finding interesting females .
I mean , uh , that' s the way your life has been though .
Right ?
You' re like , uh - like Don Juan .
Winston , please stop saying that .
Hey .
About this letter - I did examine the postmark under my microscope .
<i>And it is too faint to read, </ i> <i>but the stamp- </ i> it' s got on it a woodpecker .
<i>What does that mean to you ? </ i>
<i>Anything ? </ i>
Well , what I think we should do ... is to narrow down the possibilities .
Winston , this is probably someone playing a joke on me .
If not , then ... whatever .
It seems so unfair - someone to write a letter like this ... and- and- and not sign it ?
Don' t you want to know who is the mother of your son ?
My hypothetical son ?
No , Winston .
<i>I don' t , okay ? </ i>
Okay .
Then we can just drop it .
<i>We can ? </ i>
We can , of course .
Okay .
<i>Good . </ i>
It' s dropped .
But then how can you ignore something like this ?
- You need to treat this as a sign .
- What kind of sign ?
<i>Of the direction of your life . </ i>
Of this present moment .
<i>You need to solve this mystery ... </ i> and find out which of your women it was that you impregnated with your semen 20 years ago .

I need the possibilities of who the mother might be .
You give me a list of all your girlfriends from back then , and then I can plan everything .

Oh , I don' t know if I would have had the time and patience to be a good mother ... to - to Ron' s children .

I' m a stalker in a Taurus .

<i>I have a lot of respect for you . </ i>

It takes a lot of courage to say what you said .
I' m very proud of you .
<i>And I want you to know that</ i> <i>I think you' re doing very , very well ... </ i> <i>and I believe in you . </ i>

Thank you .
I' m sorry , Mr. Johnston , but Dr. Markowski only takes appointments , and she' s in a session right now .
Is your animal friend with you ?
Uh , no , l- l- I don' t have an animal friend .
I' m an old friend of Carm - uh , Dr. Markowski' s .
Um , Carmen has a really tight schedule .
She may have a minute , if you want to sit down .
Yeah , okay .

Don ?
[ Chuckles ]
So , you' re an animal psychic ?
No .
I' m a communicator .
And you' re a doctor now ?
Mmm .
When we were together , you were so passionate about becoming a lawyer .
I mean , you were ... very passionate .
Yeah , well , passion' s a funny thing .
<i>I have a doctorate</ i> <i>in animal behavior . </ i>
But that was sort of after the fact .
It' s an odd story .
I' m getting into odd stories .
[ Sighs ]
Well , I was a very successful lawyer .
I had no life , though , outside my work , except for my dog , Winston .
Your dog' s named Winston ?
<i>Yes . </ i>
<i>But then he died ... </ i> suddenly .
I' m sorry .
Oh , no .
It was , uh -
It was years ago .
But my new ability was this gift .
This gift from Winston .
All right , you can come in again .
Anyway , <i>after Winston died</ i> <i>I got this gift . </ i>
<i>To- </ i>
To read animals ' minds ?
<i>No .
I told you</ i> -
- No .
- I' m a communicator .
You see , soon after Winston died ...
I realized that I could hear animals speak to me .
I mean , I certainly hadn' t been aware of that before .
And I don' t read animals ' minds .
<i>But when they want</ i> <i>to communicate, </ i>
<i>I can hear them . </ i>
You know , like you and I are talking .
<i>But we don' t</ i> <i>read each other' s minds . </ i>
Is he saying something ?
He says you have a hidden agenda .
He - He said that ?
I think you' d better go back outside now , Ramon .
<i>Animals can tell us</ i> <i>what they want, </ i> but that doesn' t mean that that' s what' s best for them .

Oh .
Okay .
Um , give me one more minute .
<i>Sorry , Don , but I really</ i> <i>can' t keep Skippy waiting . </ i>
Do you think you could tell Skippy that you' re just gonna walk me to my car ?
How about later ?
Wanna get a drink ?
No .
I don' t drink .
Maybe get something to eat ?
I don' t , uh , eat .
You don' t ?
Uh , take a walk ?
I know you walk .
I don' t feel like it .
Do you have a typewriter ?
A typewriter ?
Are you married ?
You know , I think you should probably go now .
Oh , come on , Carmen .
Can' t you answer me ?
No .
" No , " you won' t answer me ?

No , I' m not married .
I was though .
Any kids ?
Yes .

That' s my report , Sherlock .
The general outline of what you put me through .
That' s it ?
And after all that , you' re still no closer to knowing who' s the mother of your son ?
That' s right .
But there was that one typewriter .
And the pink motorcycle .
And it was Dora' s pink , uh , business card .
And- And- And Laura' s pink bathrobe .
I think this whole thing is a farce , a fiasco .
As far as I know , you may have written that letter to me .
Look , I' m really sorry that you got beat up and everything .
L- l- l- I feel that it was somehow my fault .
It was .
Kind of strange , too , how , uh ,
Carmen' s magic dog was named Winston .
Yeah - [ Stammers ]
Look , man , I really put a lot of work into this thing .
I thought that it was really important that you know whether or not you had a son .
I mean , it' s your life .
You got to live your life , right ?
I <i>was</ i> living my life , Winston .
I still am .
What' s this ?
It' s pink .
It' s a note I found in my foyer when I got back .
Red ink on pink paper .
It' s from Sherry .
What ?
From Sherry ?
Why didn' t you tell me ?
May I see it ?
Envelope and paper not exactly the same size .
You know , the handwriting ... seems pretty close to the address on the envelope , but I can' t be sure .
Sherry still likes you .
You think that Sherry could have sent the first letter ... and made the whole thing up just to fuck with you ?
Who knows ?
You know , I' ve got to go .
I think I have just enough time to stop home and compare the handwriting ... and then hopefully punch in at work on time .
You coming ?
No .
I just need a little break from all of this .
Look , don' t worry .
We' re still going to solve this mystery .
[ Engine Starts ]
Didn' t I see you at the airport last night ?
I don' t know .
Did you ?
Yeah .
You on a road trip ?
Yeah .
Something like that .
You look hungry .
Can I buy you a sandwich or something ?
Uh , no , that' s okay .
You can relax .
I' m not gay .
I' m not a cop .
Just a guy who sees a guy who might need a sandwich .
Okay .
Thanks .
But could you get something to go ?
I' d sorta rather stay outside .
Sure .
How about a nice club sandwich ?
I' m vegetarian .
You eat cheese ?
Yeah , sometimes .
L- I like cheese .
Okay , I got it .
I' il be right back .
<i>[ Door Opens , Closes ] </ i>

Big cheese and veggie sandwich ... with mushrooms .

Two waters .
Two coffees .
My mom put that there ... <i>for good luck . </ i>
Thanks for the food .
Ahh .
No problem , chief .
You called me chief ?
Yeah .
Why ?

I , uh -
I ran into somebody .

You a gangster ?
No .

No , I was , uh - I was in computers .

What about you , chief ?
I' m interested in , uh , philosophy .
Philosophy and girls .
Sounds pretty good .
Think so ?
So , uh , as just a guy who gave another guy a sandwich , you have any , like , philosophical tips or anything ... for a guy on a kind of road trip ?
You asking me ?
Yeah .
Well -
The past is gone .
I know that .
The future ... isn' t here yet , whatever it' s going to be .
So , all there is is - is this .
The present .
That' s it .
Are you a Buddhist ?
No .
Are you ?
Uh , I' m not sure yet .
I' m sorry that' s the best I have to offer at the moment .
No , I appreciate it .
I like what you said .
It' s better than some , like , fatherly- sounding bullshit .
Is that ... what your father' s like ?
Ah , that' s not a good subject .
Hey , I gotta go , man .
I' m sorry .
Thanks again for the sandwich and stuff .
Hold on a second .
Wait .
I know you think that I' m your father , don' t you ?
What ?
Just tell me .
You can talk to me , chief .
Man , you' re fucked up .
Wait a second .
