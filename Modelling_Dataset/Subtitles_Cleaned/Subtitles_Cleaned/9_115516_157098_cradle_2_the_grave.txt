Okay .

I hate these things .
Don' t you hate these things ?
Just doing my job .
Then again , you never know who you' re gonna meet , right ?

Right , well , I suppose I should go see what they' re selling .
Tommy .
Change of plans , he' s gay .
You' re up .

<i>Aloha . </ i>
Hi .
I hope you don' t take offense to this ... ... but I have such a weakness for a man in uniform .
- Lf that' s your thing .
- Uniforms are my thing .
I mean , every time I see a sailor , all I can think about is seafood .
I' m actually not supposed to be talking on duty .
Who' s talking ?
Baby , this is flirting .
Unless you' re one of those big handsome men letting it all go to waste on a woman .
The world is full of fools .
Yahtzee !
- What' s it looking like ?
- About a six- second rotation .
Tommy .
But you can call me Rachel .
Douglas .
I just hope I' m not too ... ... pretty for you .
- I' m hooked up .
- That bitch .
I like sunsets , puppy dogs ...
I' m big in the pants .
I can almost tie it in a knot .
Let' s get the table .
One day I' il have to come in here and do a little shoplifting and let you catch me .
Resist arrest just so you can wrestle me down ... ... and cuff me .
I can be pretty rough .
Don' t get me excited now .
Faith .
Faith .
Faith .
Holy shit !
Earthquake .
But I bet you can hit a 10 on the Richter scale anytime , Douglas .
Let' s do it .
All right .
Y' all know what to do .
Let' s get it on .

<i> - I want to report a robbery in progress . </ i>
Robbery in progress .

Oh , yeah ?

This ...
This I can use .
T.
Check this out .
This is what we came for .

Jackpot .

Your employer betrayed you .
The police are on the way .
<i> - Leave the stones . </ i>

Let' s hope that was part of the plan .
Who' s in charge ?
Who wants to know ?
Follow me .
Vanessa .
What are you still doing up ?

- Just a little longer ?
Sweetheart , you have school tomorrow .
Come on .
Time for bed .
- Getting heavy !
- No , I' m not .
Wait a minute .
There' s something behind your ear .
Please .
That is so lame .
- What you mean ?
- It' s in your hand .
This hand ?
Or this hand ?
Watch .
- How' d you do that ?
- Magic .
- Is it for me ?
- Of course it' s for you .
A diamond for my princess .
It' s beautiful .
- So are you .
- I love you , Daddy .
I love you too .
Let' s say our prayers .
Angels east , angels west , north and south , just do your best ... ... to guard her and watch her while she rests .
- Amen .
- Amen .
Give me some love .
Can I have another one ?
Yeah , you can have another one .
Vanessa' s in the bed now .
- She' il be asleep for the rest of the night .
- She won' t listen to me .
I' il talk to her .
Go to sleep anytime .
- I' m watching TV if you need me .
- All right .
Thank you .
Player , what the hell happened ?
Should we be considering a long vacation in a warm foreign climate with no extradition ?
The cat that called was only interested in the black stones .
- Christophe sold us out .
- Or something .
- Oh , God , you made it .
- By the skin of my black ass .
Man , some Chinese dude kicked my ass all around that goddamn train track .
Asshole busted my earpiece too .
- And the worst part , he snagged the loot .
- Shit !
Maybe it' s time to rethink this no- gun policy shit .
A little ass- whupping ain' t shit .
At least you didn' t have to play all foxy with the rent- a- cop !
- This all we got .
- So , what do we do now ?
- Wait to hear from me .
- So where are you going ?
I' m going to get some answers .
- Hold up , dog .
I got your back .
- I got this one .
But if I need you , I' il call you .
- All right .
- All right ?
Be careful .
So this is Mr. Christophe .
Apparently we' re not his first visitors today .
Please , <i>Se√±or</ i> Ling , have mercy .
Whatever you' re going to say , make it the truth .
You may not have another opportunity .
I' il tell you what you wanna know .
Bang !
You like it ?
It' s all right .
You want it ?
I' il make you a deal on it , ammo included .
It' s got reactive armor , Browning . 50- caliber , 7 . 62 M- 60 machine gun .
And that cannon there , that' s 90 mm .
Good around the bad areas of town .
Keeps neighborhood kids in line .
- I' il pass .
- How about this ?
- A Marine corps Assault Hovercraft ?
- I' m here on other business .
Hey , Arch !
We' re out of room in the storage .
All right , put them in my office and be careful , they' re expensive .
Well , not expensive to me .
Hey , listen , you weren' t by any chance downtown today , were you , Tony ?
Not at all .
I didn' t think so .
- Ever see a black diamond ?
- I' ve seen a white diamond , pink ... ... yellow , blue ones .
I' ve seen Neil Diamond .
Awesome in concert .
He' s in town in two weeks ...
Never seen a black diamond .
Not like this .
- Wow .
You got me .
- Find out what they' re worth .
- Is there a timetable on this ?
- Yesterday .
- That' s what I figured .
- I' il be back .
Gonna return a favor to a friend .
Looks dead to me .
- Guess you got to him first .
- Not me , not my style .
You' re the one that called me .
The same one that bumped into Miles .
Who the fuck are you ?
- My name is Su .
- All right , Su , I' m Sally .
- I want the black stones .
- Make me an offer .
- You can walk out of here alive .
- No deal .
<i>Leave a message . </ i>
<i>Mr .
Fait , I know you' re there . </ i>
<i>Pick up the phone . </ i>
<i>We need to talk , now . </ i>
Who the fuck is this ?
The man for whom Christophe arranged to have the black stones ... ... brought into the country and deposited at the Jewelry Exchange .
The man who wants them back .
- Now .
- All right , well , how much ?
Maybe you didn' t understand me .
The stones are already mine .
Yo , check this out ?
I got them , I' m selling them , put the money on the wood !
I don' t have time for this .
That' s your last offer ?
I can be a very dangerous man , Mr. Fait .
I don' t get it .
Do I look like the Salvation Army ?
I bust my ass all night and got nothing to show for it .
You know what , dog ?
It don' t even matter who the fuck you are .
I ain' t got nothing for you .
Shit !
Shit !
Give us the stones .
How many times I got to tell you people ?
I' m a businessman .
Make me a fucking offer !
Here' s your offer .
That shit ain' t gonna work , homes , because I don' t have the stones !
Tell us where they are .
Come on !
The car !
What is it with these fucking stones ?
- Yeah .
- It' s Archie .
Bad news .
We got a problem .
I put word out on the street to get some info on the stones .
Next thing I know , the Wu- Tang Clan shows up here .
Three important elements here .
One , I' m outmanned ... ... two , they' re heavily armed , and three , they' re about to pound me .
- I can' t watch anymore .
I got a few licks in ...
- Let' s see the rest .
Did you see my new DVD players ?
<i>All right !
Okay ! </ i>
<i> - Give me that ! </ i>
<i> - I forgot I had them .
Sorry ! </ i>
I could' ve resisted more .
But they could' ve beat me into a coma or killed me .
How could I tell you where the stones are if I' m dead or on life support ?
So I threw in the towel , reluctantly , for your sake .
Okay , so you saved yourself to tell me something .
- So tell me .
- What ?
- Who was it ?
- I don' t know .
- What did they say ?
- Well , they said :
" Give me the stones , you fat cracker motherfucker . "
- That sort of thing .
- That' s it ?
That' s pretty bad .
Cracker is kind of racist .
Thanks for keeping yourself alive long enough to tell me nothing !
- Did you call the police ?
- Did I call the police ?
Look around here , are you crazy ?
Only question now is , who' s behind this jack move ?
I don' t know , but they got some great guns I can' t even get .
U. S. Special Forces only .
- Chambers .
- Jump chambers ?
I hope not .
Hey , who' s Jump chambers ?
This guy' s in on everything that goes down in town .
The only one I know that can get those weapons .
And he has a fucking army .
You' re on your own , I don' t need the headache .
And since I' m totally fucked , who are you ?
Yeah , you got an ID ?
Buddy ?
Picture , preferably ?
Yeah , all right .
- This means nothing to me .
- Let me see it .
It' s Taiwan , central Security Bureau .
- Taiwanese Intelligence .
- Read Chinese ?
No , but I know " cop " in every language .
What are you ?
Some kind of kung fu James Bond ?
- The stones belong to Taiwan .
- They belong to chambers now .
- I' m starting to hate this fucking phone .
- I' il get you a new one .
- Yeah .
- I hope you' ve reconsidered .
Oh , it' s bad- ass !
What' s up , homes ?
You' ve made this difficult , Mr. Fait .
Let me make it easy .
I can' t wait to hear this .
Daddy , Daddy , Daddy !
She' s very pretty in her pink pajamas , aren' t you , Vanessa ?
- Son of a ...
<i> - I want my stones , Mr. Fait</ i> .
Let me talk to the Chinese gentleman .
Don' t you fucking touch her !
The Chinese gentleman , please .
He has my daughter .
He wants to talk to you .
Jesus , Tony .
What happened ?
What did you just do ?
I said I have the stones , and I won' t negotiate for your daughter .
- What ?
- That' s stupid .
It will confuse him , buy us time , keep her alive .
What the hell are you talking about ?
This motherfucker has my baby !
Look , I know him .
I want the stones , you want your daughter .
We can help each other .
So I' m stuck with you .
Get in .
We gotta see chambers .
Find a place to put her .
My daddy' s gonna come and kick your butts !
Su says he has the stones .
But why cut me off ?
Why not negotiate for the girl ?
Doesn' t make any sense .
Buyers fly in tomorrow .
Should we stop them ?
We' il never regain their confidence .
We need information .
Find the right people , pay whatever it costs .
Something' s not right .
Something' s happening with the stones .
What about the girl ?
We' il need her .
She stays alive ... ... for now .
Yeah , I' m on my way to see chambers now .
No , I don' t have a choice .
Get in touch with his people , let him know I need to see him .
I' il call you back .
I' m sorry about your daughter .
- How old is she ?
- Mind your business .
She' s 8 .
She' il be 9 in September .
Mine is 15 .
- Boyfriends ?
- Never .
I' d kill them .
You wish .
- About time you PMD .
- PMD ?
Yeah , put me down .
What' s this all about ?
- The stones are not what you think they are .
- No shit .
- What about this guy who has Vanessa ?
- He' s exactly what you think he is .
A thief and a killer .
Great .
Fucking great .
I want my daddy !
Keys .
Where' d you get this piece of shit ?
Let' s just say Grandma and Grandpa have a long walk back from the campground .
- You sure you cleaned it out ?
- It' s clean , all right .
- Shut up !
- You shut up !
Go to sleep !
<i>Angels east , angels west ... </ i> ... north and south , just do your best ... ... to guard her and watch her while she rests .
Amen .
Who rang that bell ?
Here are your visitors , Mr. Chambers .
And the morning mail .
Hey , yo , Vogel .
My DVD‚Äô s broke .
Get you a new one straight away , Mr. Chambers .
Well , well , well .
Tony Fait .
Come all this way to visit his old pal Jump .
Who' s the gook ?
Chinese guy .
Hey .
No shoes in my crib , man .
- How you doing , Jump ?
- Don' t waste my fucking time , nigga .
- Look , I got a problem .
- How' s Daria ?
- Good .
- Yeah , she always was good .
From the moment I saw her to the moment you took her away from me .
- Problem ?
- The black stones .
That bitch brought in too .
I made a lot of money with her , but that' s all stopped now .
You stopped that .
You decided it was okay to put an end to that .
- Black stones , what ?
- I need them back .
The only smart thing you did was not pimping her yourself .
See , because then I' d have been real heated and you' d have been real dead .
But you don' t pimp , right ?
You' re just a thief in the night , stealing shit that don' t belong to you .
Hey .
- What ?
He don' t talk ?
- I don' t speak Korean .
Yeah , well , I do .
Bought me a little Korean spot downtown .
Bringing in the soul brothers 24- 7 , 365 .
Black man gouging Koreans .
Ain' t that a switch , chick ?
Them motherfuckers got faces like walls , but they love to drink and look at naked girls .
Place ain' t no shitbox .
You should see my office .
Got that shit decked out like a kabuki love palace .
You know what that is , right ?
Why don' t you roll by sometime ?
Check out the poon .
My little girl is mixed up in this .
If I don' t get those stones back , she' s dead .
What do you want , man ?
I mean ...
- I' m begging .
- You know , I was thinking .
That was a big heist .
Risky heist .
What would make a man go through that kind of trouble , take that kind of heat ?
Gotta be something good .
Something valuable .
Jump ... ... it' s my little girl .
Make another one .
You mother ...
Drama .
I see the slope' s no dope .
Got a lot of offspring running around , brother .
Big score is once in a lifetime .
- Yo , let me at him .
- Go ahead .
Shit .
Say hey to Daria for me .
Don' t forget your fucking shoes .
Pussy .
I used to really look up to that guy .
Used to want to be just like him .
- In Taiwan , I can make him talk .
- Yeah , well , this ain' t Taiwan .
Only thing we can do now is try to find out where the stones are and get them .
- You make it sound easy .
- It won' t be .
- What ?
- They' re at his club .
How do you know ?
I know .
I can just feel it .
It' s never happened to you ?
No .
- Thought you Chinese were all mystical .
- We like to gamble .
Not guess .
It' s no guess , but I could be wrong .
I' il hit the club , you go see Archie .
Why ?
- He has to remember something .
- What if he can' t ?
Pretend it' s Taiwan .
Make him remember .
Hey .
Get away from here .
What are you doing ?
Relax .
I' m just seeing if I can help with something .
Well , you can' t .
It' s very delicate equipment , so just stay away .
All right ?
Stay away from the truck .
- What ?
- Stay away from my fucking truck !
Okay , stop it .
Backing away .
Backing away .
Someone give the geek his Ritalin .
At least he' s doing his job ... ... which is more than I can say for some people .
Tape her up and gag her .
I want my daddy !
I want my daddy !
I want my daddy !
I want my daddy !
I want my daddy !
I want my daddy !
- I want my daddy !
- Let go of me !
- Shut up !
- I want my daddy !
- I want my daddy !
- Waste of time .
I can think of a way of shutting you up .
Yes !
Shit !
She' s got the key !
- Precious Daria .
- What' s up , Odion ?
Long time , no see .
- So , what brings you around here ?
- Sometimes you need to see old friends .
- What ?
You got trouble ?
- With a capital T.
Tony Fait ?
Thought you two were tight .
Bonnie and Clyde .
Yeah , it used to be that way .
Not taking care of me these days .
Kid' s all he cares about .
It' s a shame , huh ?
- So , what you want me to do ?
- I don' t know .
Probably nothing you can do .
I just thought ... ... you know .
This is crazy .
I don' t even know what I was thinking .
I shouldn' t be in here .
Sorry .
No , hold up , hold up .
Girls .
- Give us a minute .
Champagne ?
- Yes .
I got it .
- So you looking for a job ?
- I need something .
How about you work here ?
How would Jump feel about me coming back and all ?
You let me worry about Jump chambers .
In the meantime ... ... how about we go to my office and we talk about this a little bit more ?
It' s not exactly boxing matches , it' s a lot more dangerous .
No gloves or nothing , no rules , period .
It' s huge money .
It' s very illegal .
They hold it during the day to fool cops .
The man you remember , how do you know he' il be here ?
I don' t , but this is chambers ' operation , so it' s a damn good place to start .
Here we are .
- This is a private club .
You can' t come in .
- It' s me , Archie .
- Everybody likes me here .
- Hey , it' s that asshole Archie again .
How can you recognize him ?
Well , I didn' t see his face , but they all kind of look the same .
Of course so do you guys .
No offense .
But I will remember that pinky ring because it was awesome .
He' s got , like , a 10- carat , round cut , square setting , good color and clarity .
I remember thinking about the damage it' d do to my face if he hit me .
I gotta make sure Mr. Pinky Ring doesn' t recognize me , so I got a disguise .
- How do we get in ?
- Leave it to me .
I' il take care of it .
Hey , buddy .
How you doing ?
How' s that armor- plated Lincoln I sold you ?
- Cops stopped me .
- They do that sometimes .
- Car was fucking hot , Archie .
- Hey .
I didn' t steal it , but stop by the shop tomorrow .
I' il make it right .
- You know the rules .
No guests .
- He' s not .
He' s a fighter .
An unofficial entry .
- Him ?
Is he any good ?
- Is he ... ?
He' il kick all those chumps ' asses !
He' il go Chinese on them !
Teeth will fly .
Blood will splatter !
It‚Äô il be awesome !
Step aside .
No way , Archie .
No more favors .
What ?
You' ve got to be shitting me .
Somebody' s getting a letter from the Better Business Bureau .
Excuse us .
You' re number 12 .
Go get your ass kicked .
I didn' t come here to fight .
You don' t have to fight , I just said that to get us in .
Come on !
Get up !
Oh , yeah .
Get up !
Yeah !
Yeah !
Tear his eye out !
- On a good day , over a million bucks will ...
- Just find the ring .
- All right .
Okay .
- Knock him out .
- You know ...
- Bullshit . ... this could take a little while .
All right , come on .
Let' s go .
Sit down .
Why don' t you put on some music ?
Slower .
Just relax .
And watch .
This looks good .
Set it up , tie it at the bottom .
- Tommy , go .
- Here come the bug man .
Excuse me .
Hey , what' s going on , player ?
- Yo , what the hell are you doing ?
- Oh , pest control , player .
- Don' t tell me you didn' t get the notice .
- What notice ?
That' s what burn my ass to the bone , a brother just trying to make a living ...
You know what ?
That' s beside the point .
If you had gotten your notice , you' d realize the city has a new ordinance ... ... saying I gotta spray businesses catering to foreigners .
How come ?
The foreigners are bringing over them scary- ass foreign bugs , man .
They coming here in their luggage .
It' s my job to prevent possible infestation ... ... and contamination .
That' s my job .
- We doing business inside .
I can' t let you come and hose the place with bug spray .
Maybe you need to talk to your manager about that plan because that' s my job .
- Manager' s busy .
- Okay , that' s your call .
That is your call , player .
But just remember this .
First thing tomorrow morning ... ... the city ... ... they gonna send their quarantine people .
- Quarantine people ?
They gonna shut you down .
Non- compliance .
Wait , wait , wait .
Hold on .
Hold , man , come here .
Let me talk to you for a minute .
You ain' t fucking with me , are you ?
See that little motherfucker up there ?
That' s me .
That' s me .
I am a licensed exterminator , man .
Why I gotta fuck with you ?
Look .
Come here .
Let' s do this .
You take me to a small place .
Small room .
Office or something .
Someplace upstairs , away from the customers .
That way when I set these bombs off , the fumes , they don' t go down there .
And then we come back later and fix the rest .
All right ?
- Okay .
Get a couple bombs .
Come on .
- That' s what I' m talking about .
You don' t wanna be bit by one of these motherfuckers .
Swell you up all around the neck .
Look like Oprah .
Come on , get the door .
You know , some of these bugs they got E. Coli and Mad cow disease .
Check this shit out .
Is this Jackie Chan‚Äô s office ?
Oh , snap !
Man , you got a Jacuzzi ?
Look at the ball .
How many freaks you get in here ?
I bet you sit yours right there on that ball .
Sit on the ball , baby .
Sit on the ball .
Keep it wet , baby .
- Smack !
Smack it !
Smack it !
- Hey !
Hey !
- Just do your thing and go , bro .
- Yeah , all right , player .
All right .
Look here .
Now you keep the door closed ... ... and give this shit a full hour before anybody steps in here , all right ?
Damn .
Damn .
<i> - You' re clear . </ i>
- Let' s do it .
All right .
- You' re crazy .
- I' m a father .
- Blow it .
<i> - Daria ... </ i> <i> ... get ready to move</ i> .
What was that ?
" Sometimes you just need an old friend ? "
- It came from the office .
- Watch her .
Don' t let her leave .
- They' re not here ?
- They' re here .
- They' re just somewhere else .
- What are you talking about ?
- He stashed them here somewhere .
- What the hell we gonna do ?
- Everybody just go .
- But , T , what about you , man ?
I gotta save Vanessa .
I gotta find them !
- I' m not leaving you .
- Yes , you are .
Now go !
- Right here .
Hurry up .
Come on .
- Oh , shit .
Come on , dog .
They' re right outside .
Shut the fuck up and get out of here !
You know , I got the big one .
- Yeah ?

Keep it in your pants .
Who' s in there ?
You' re wrong .
What you want ?
- Yeah !
- Move away from him .
Come on .
Nice cubic .
Yours are real .
Not .
I told you this was gonna take a while .
I was thinking about those diamonds so I made a few calls .
My Defense Department connection called me back and he tells me ... ... about this rumor out of Taiwan about these black stones .
Only they' re not jewels .
- Pretty beat up .
- Fell down the stairs .
Enjoy the jail sex , Fait .
Seven advances , 11 ' s out !
Next up , 8 versus 12 !
Eight versus 12 !
Fighters report to the cage !
Let' s go .
We' re still here , T.
Got anything you want us to do ?

Unofficial entry number 12 !

- Hey , 12' s right here !
Kind of small , ain' t he ?
Let' s go , chickenshit .
You' re the chickenshit , buddy !
Not today .
I know this wasn' t the plan , but if you don' t get in and fight ... ... they' il throw us out and we' il never find this guy .
- Sorry .
- Just find the ring .
- Hey .
Two grand on the white guy .
- You got it , Archie .
Let' s go !
Come on !
Are you ready ?
Are you ready ?
You win .

Get your ass back in there !
Put me down !
Goddamn !

Come on !
Kick his ass !
Kick him .
Take him down .
- Okay .
He' s all patched up .
- Ready to move .
Let' s go .
Get the car .
Stay close .
Hey !
That guy' s got my fucking quad !
I' m gonna get that motherfucker !
Hey !
Wait !
Five grand on the chinaman .
He' s my friend .
<i>At this very moment , a man</ i> <i>identified as Anthony Fait is leading ... </ i> <i> ... police on a wild high- speed chase</ i> <i>through downtown Los Angeles . </ i>
<i>And get this , folks . </ i>
<i>He' s driving an all- terrain vehicle . </ i>
Yeah !
Come on !
Kick his ass !
Oh , yeah !
Come on .
Come on down .
That' s the way to get that buck .
<i> - Yo . </ i>
- I' m here .
<i>Aboveground parking garage</ i> <i>in Chinatown .
Get there . </ i>
I know the place .
Hey .
Thanks , man .
- Do you like my new ring ?
- Where is he ?
Well , open the door .
Glad I brought my stunner .
All right , bud .
You ready for the q and a ?
Where' d you put the stones ?
I ain' t selling you shit till I know where the ceiling is .
How much money do you want for the stones ?
- Where' s my fucking butter ?
- It' s almost ready .
See , I hate foreplay .
Fucking warm- up .
A bitch gotta be ready to come off the bench and score some points .
Just take the rock to the motherfucking hoop strong .
You dig ?
Instead of doing this back- and- forth shit , my idea is you come up with a number .
A very high number .
You see , I' m throwing a number so high ... ... that when I hear it just ...
It just gets me off .
And then , bam !
Bust a nut , roll over , go to sleep .
You like that ?
Yeah , I like that .
Oh , shit !
Hey , hey , hey , hey !
Shit !
Okay , okay , okay !
<i>And it looks like this parking garage is where</ i> <i>it will end .
As police have sealed ... </ i> <i> ... the building and continue</ i> <i>their search inside for the man who ... </ i> <i> ... led them on what certainly had to</ i> <i>be the most extreme chase we' ve ever seen . </ i>
<i> - Don' t know why these idiots do it , Barbara . </ i>
<i> - They never get away , do they ? </ i>
<i>They sure don' t , and they just endanger</ i> <i>innocent citizens in the process . </ i>
<i>Here' s another car exiting the structure . </ i>
<i>Police talking to the driver, </ i> <i>inspecting the vehicle . </ i>
<i>Well , the police know they have him</ i> <i>trapped inside the parking structure . </ i>
<i>Knowing cops the way I do , I can tell you</ i> <i>they' re good and PO' d , excuse my language . </ i>
<i>And they' re not about to let this guy</ i> <i>slip through their fingers . </ i>
Mr. Chambers is resting .
He says not to bother him .
<i>Hey , baby . </ i>
<i>Please don' t go . </ i>
<i>You want me to stay ? </ i>
<i>Yeah , I need someone to stay here</ i> <i>and help keep me awake . </ i>
<i>Wait a minute . </ i>
<i>I know that face . </ i>
<i>A lot of men had that look on their face</ i> <i>when I got married . </ i>
I knew the stones were in there .
He was a tough guy at first , but when I got close to his nuts he sang like C√©line Dion .
How we gonna get them out of there ?
That place is always jumping .
Yo , dog , something' s not right .
I got the same feeling .
The doorman .
Where is he ?
Everybody stay put .
- Sorry .
- Watch my nuts , all right ?
No chambers ' guys .
Something' s wrong .
This guy looks better dead .
He said they were here in the fountain .
Where are they ?
This can' t be fucking happening .
They have to be here !
That' s it ?
One stone ?
- Ling .
He has the rest .
- How the fuck do you know ?
I know .
Okay .
He has the stones .
I mean , she can' t hurt him .
She' s just a little girl .
She' s only 8 years old .
He' il let her go , right ?
He' il just fucking let her go !
What am I gonna do ?
We have to go .
Now .
- We' re back in business .
- Good .
- We don' t have to babysit much longer .
- I hate kids .
- Is everything else ready ?
- Just have to test the device .
It' s called the Dimaster Oscillator .
Not test .
Calibrate .
Which I' m now ready to do .
Goggles ?
Here you go , man .
Thanks .
Please work .
Please work .
Please work .
Daddy , please .
Daddy , please .
Please answer , Daddy , answer .
Want me to get that ?
- Yeah ?
- Daddy ?
Vanessa ?
<i>Daddy , please , come and get me ... </ i> ... I wanna go home !
Calm down , baby .
Calm down .
Where are you ?
<i>I don' t know ! </ i>
I' m in a van inside a big building .
<i>They painted the windows . </ i>
<i>I can' t look out ! </ i>
You gotta help me , sweetheart .
I have to know where you are .
<i> - I' m scared ! </ i>
- I know you are , honey .
Just try to stay calm .
Concentrate .
Look around .
What do you see ?
<i>I don' t know .
I can' t see anything . </ i>
You gotta try , sweetheart .
Try to see something .
I' m going .
I' m trying .
I see chairs and green light .
Chairs .
Green light .
Where' s the light coming from ?
I can' t tell .
There' s a machine .
It' s like a laser show .
- Laser show ?
<i> - Daddy ... </ i> ... hurry !
I' m scared !
<i> - I wanna go home ! </ i>
- Okay , baby .
Calm down .
<i>It' s gonna be okay . </ i>
Daddy' s coming !
Daddy ?
- Vanessa ?
<i> - Daddy ! </ i>
<i>Vanessa ? </ i>
Vanessa !
Great !
Shit !
- He' s doing it here tonight .
- Doing what ?
Selling the stones .
The Thai laser emits green light .
He needs it to enrich them .
- To show their power .
- What the hell are you talking about ?
What are these stones ?
A new form of synthetic plutonium .
Small and portable , but mega- powerful .
Am I right ?
There' s a bunch of international scumbags who' d pay a lot of money ... ... to get their hands on those .
And then , look out world .
Enough of this shit !
How' s it gonna get me back my daughter ?
We' re operational .
The buyers will want to arrive and leave quickly .
Somewhere private , accessible by aircraft .
Vanessa did say she was inside of a big building .
Could be a hangar .
There' s about a dozen little airports around here , man .
We ain' t gonna never get them all .
- Flight plans .
- Yeah , flight plans .
They gotta list a destination .
Every aircraft that takes off ... ... has to file one with the Aviation Administration or risk getting shot down ... ... by the U. S. Military .
So you get that list ... ... and maybe we can find out where the sale' s going down .
Daria , call the aviation people .
Use our L. A. P. D. Credentials .
We need flight info on all aircrafts coming in or going out .
Miles , the no- gun policy is no longer in effect .
Break out the heat .
Everybody else , get ready to move .
Tommy , create a diversion .
I got just the thing if we can fit in it .
Wick Airfield .
Five private choppers arriving tonight within minutes of each other .
- Sounds like our best bet .
- Better be for Vanessa‚Äô s sake .
Let' s go .
You are the world' s foremost arms dealers .
You all know that weaponry equals power , and in the world of weaponry ... ... nukes rule .
But nuclear material is hard to obtain and difficult to handle .
But what if it weren' t ?
That' s the question that brought you here tonight .
And this is the answer .
A unique , man- made element .
In its present state it' s completely inert .
Zero radiation ...
... zero volatility .
One small fragment easily transformed into a source of immense energy .
More powerful than weapons- grade plutonium 100 times its size .
Goggles on .
<i>So , what the hell does Taiwan</ i> <i>gotta do with this ? </ i>
<i>We developed the stones . </ i>
<i>They belong to us . </ i>
<i>Okay , what about the guy you' re after ? </ i>
<i>How come you know him so well ? </ i>
<i>We grew up together . </ i>
<i>We joined the government at the same time . </ i>
<i>Wait a minute .
Wait a minute . </ i>
<i>You were on the same side ? </ i>
<i>He betrayed us .
He killed our team . </ i>
<i>He tried to kill me too . </ i>
<i>If you don' t take this</ i> <i>motherfucker out , I will . </ i>
<i>The stones first , then him . </ i>
Creating a highly reactive radioactive isotope ... ... requires altering the atomic structure of the original material .
Normally this is accomplished by adding neutrons .
Here , we' re using electromagnetic distillation to strip away protons .
In the process , the fragment' s potential yield is increasing exponentially .
We' re now reaching the yield level of a sidewinder missile .
Enough power to take out a tank .
A Tomahawk cruise missile , enough to destroy a building .
Scud .
That' s a few city blocks gone .
Hiroshima .
Two Hiroshimas .
New world order .
The purpose of today' s sale is to begin trading ... ... a new commodity on the black market and to determine its value .

<i>Two armed sentries . </ i>
<i>Checking the perimeter . </ i>
<i>Perimeter is clear . </ i>
I' m moving inside .
They' re still doing the deal .
There' s a camper there .
<i> - And the windows is painted out . </ i>

So glad the angels kept you safe .
Another one ?

Ever .
Guess we both got what we wanted .
So , what happens to the stones now ?
They' il be destroyed .
Guess I' il be spending some time in jail .
Jail ?
Come on , man .
He just saved the planet , man .
Can' t he at least get probation ?
I' il do what I can .
- Thanks .
- That' s great .
Because we make a hell of a team , am I right ?
Except for you .
You' re law enforcement .
But we gotta stick together .
And a white guy comes in handy .
You wanna rip off a country club , or somebody needs to hail a cab .
Right ?
- So , what percentage are we talking ?
- None .
That low , huh ?
It' s about time I got my shit together .
- About time we all did .

So you guys are all just gonna up and go straight ?
Yeah .
You ought to try it yourself , man .

And don' t be disrespecting her .
- I know her .
Remember the party ?
- She whipped your ass .
No , she sucker- punched me .
That ain' t the first time you been sucker- punched by a big woman .
You know , I think I got kind of a fetish .
Did you just say my mama had a fat ass ?
No , I said I have a kind of a fetish for big women .
- Oh .
But she do got a fat ass though .
- Yeah , she does have a fat ass .
You can see it when she' s sitting on your head .
I' ve seen it .
I had to rub that ass naked when I was a teenager .
You know , you look a lot like her .
Except her hair is different .
Yeah .
I shave my beard , she keeps hers growing .
- Yeah .
You know what ?
- What ?
I' m gonna write a movie about all the shit we got through .
I' ve been taking notes .
It' s gonna make a lot of money .
I' m calling it <i>Sidekicks</ i> .
We' re the real stars of this .
We shot down the damn helicopter .
- Who' s playing you ?
- I' ve been thinking about that .
First I thought Arnold Schwarzenegger , then I saw him at the gas station ...
- Midget .
- He' s like 5' 6 " .
- Midget .
- Got a terrible lisp .
So I' il go with Mel Gibson .
We have similar features .
Right .
I see the forehead .
- Yeah .
And you ?
Guess .
- Denzel !
Denzel !
- You noticed I' ve been cutting it down .
- And he' s been beefing up .
- I' m trying to get it down to Denzel' s weight .
- You know who will be your girlfriend ?
Oprah .
- Big Oprah or little Oprah ?
- Medium Oprah .
That' s the one I like because the eyes are straight .
- This is about reality .
- Right .
Realism .
- Yeah .
So you know who' s my girlfriend ?
- Who ?
Halle Berry .
And let me tell you why .
It' il add a whole different element .
This is gonna be an interracial couple .
She' s never done that before .
Also , Fait .
I' ve been thinking about that a lot .
I' il go with Shaquille O' Neal .
The most dominating player ever in the NBA .
You saw <i>Kazaam</ i> .
- Right - It wasn' t the right material .
He' s gonna kill with this stuff .
And Su , I' ve been thinking about him .
- Remember the movie <i>Sixteen Candles</ i> ?

She' d play a thief .
She a good actress .
The whole elbow thing .
Remember when she' s going to court and hit the one elbow , broke that elbow .
- Electricity went through her body .
- She' s a ventriloquist with the elbows .
Now who do we get to direct this thing ?
You know what ?
We should get the same dude that directed <i>Romeo Must Die</ i> and <i>Exit Wounds</ i> .
- The director , the Pole , Polack .

Yeah , we' il get him in there .
<i>Exit Wounds</ i> , did you see that ?

I heard they' re gay .
Yeah , of course .
Hollywood .
