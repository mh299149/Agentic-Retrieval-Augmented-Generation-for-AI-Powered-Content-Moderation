- Dale Hessman , please .
Hello ?
You got the disk three minutes ago .
What took you so long ?
I was having too much fun with this " Mozart' s Ghost " .
I sent you a whopper of a virus .
Be careful with the " escape " button .
Here' s the problem .
Click on " concert information " .
" Houston Utilities " .
I think you took a wrong turn here .
Not quite " Ticketmaster " , is it ?
See anything unusual ?
No , it looks like a normal Web page , except for that icon .
Click on it . then press " contrl- shift " .
- My God !
- What do you make ofit ?
It' s just a glitch that sends you to the wrong internet address .
Last night I got Amtrak and the Mayo Clinic .
They have different subnets .
I accessed a system I shouldn' t have .
That disk is power
Then find the error and delete it .
I' m not ready to do that yet .
What' s your day like tomorrow ?
No !
I' m going on my first vacation in six years .
- It' s reserved and confirmed .
- What time' s your flight ?
Twelve .
But I have to pack ...
- Wait till I get back .
- I don' t think so .
- Tell me what this is about .
- Not on the phone .
I can fly down tonight in my Cessna .
I could be there by breakfast .
Angela , you know this shit better than anyone .
Fine ...
See you at seven .
So , they finally get to meet !

- Okay , Burbank .
But it looks okay .
- Cathedral Software .
- Russ Melbourne , please .
Angela !
I thought you' d be long gone .
- We really need yourgenius .
- I' m far from being a genius .
Just think about it .
We can' t take on someone new to replace Dale .
- Because ofoursecurity problems .
- Replace Dale ?
- You' re kidding , right ?
- I thought you' d heard .
What happened ?
Dale' s dead .
His plane crashed outside L. A.
- He was coming to see me .
- It puts things in perspective .
Let' s talk when you get back .
And ... try to have a good vacation .
Okay , I' il talk to you soon , Russ .
Plenty of time .
Ain' t nothing coming in or going out for an hour .
Ladies and gentlemen , yourattention please .
We are sorry to announce that there is a computermalfunction ...
The whole airport is down .

... a blood test taken last week at Bethesda Naval Hospital revealed - - that Undersecretary ofDefence Bergstrom was infected with AlDS .
- You okay ?
- It' s just all these people ...
- I meant would you like a refill ?
- Oh no , I' ve had three already .
- I could fly myself to Mexico .
- Looks like you won' t have to .
Waiter ?
I' d like a Gibson , please .
It' s a Martini . with an onion instead of a olive .
Thanks .
Could I have one too , please ?
I' il take mine up at the bar .
- I didn' t think anyone drank them .
- Maybe I' m not so unfashionable .
- Is that business or pleasure ?
- Is there a difference ?
Not a great deal , if you' re a hacker .
Nice hardware .
I assume you' re in the business ?
- Isn' t everybody ?
- Nope .
God , we' re pathetic , aren' t we ?
Excuse me ?
Well . we' re here .
We' re sitting on a perfect beach , and all we can think about is ...
- Where can I hook up my modem ?
- Exactly .
I' m Jack Devlin .
- Angela Bennett .
- Angela .
Hi .
My most embarrassing secret ?
You know " Breakfast at Tiffany' s " ?
It' s my favourite film .
I wore out my membership renting it .
You know what I' m talking about , then .
When I was about thirteen , I had this sort of ... ... identity crisis .
- I thought I was in the film .
- That you were Audrey Hepburn ?
No .
I used to think I was the cat .
I' d sit there and I' d play out the last scene of the movie - - over and over again .
You know the last scene ?
The alleyway in the pouring rain .
I' m soaked to the bone , and I' m scared . and ...
I' m abandoned .
I' m alone .
And that' s it .
Would you have dinner with me tonight ?
- Come on , it' s your last night !
- You know what ?
- I' d actually really love to .
- Great .
- It' s a company perk .
- Some perk !
I think I got a calendar one year from Cathedral .
You' re from Colorado ?
It has to be the eastern ... ... or maybe the southeastern part of the state .
The teeming metropolis of La Junta .
Population , fifty .
Is my accent that strong after all these years ?
No , it' s just a trick I do .
- After all these years ?
How long ?
- It seems like a lifetime ...
Let' s see ...
I was fifteen , going on ten , - - and we moved from La Junta to San Jos√© .
Tulsa ...
- Your father got transferred ?
- Not really .
I don' t know , he just ... transferred out , one day .
What are you looking at ?
You .
Me ?
- Computers are your life , right ?
- Yes , the perfect hiding place .
- A picture of you .
- Yeah , okay ...
- I have one or two other interests .
- Such as ?
What' s your speciality ?
Anything , pretty much .
Beta testing , mostly .
That' s way over my head .
You just go into people' s systems , find the faults . and fix them .
- What if there are no faults ?
- I don' t believe I' ve met one , yet .
- You must be a bit cold .
- Not really ...
Yeah , a little bit .
Here .
It goes round here .
- Want one ?
- I used to smoke those ...
But you quit , right ?
Well .
I refuse to .
I try to do without a safety net .
How else do you know you' re alive ?
I take my share of risks .
I don' t always floss .
I rip the tags off my pillows when they' re new .
My kind of woman !
- Feeling adventurous ?
- What did you have in mind ?
Dare you risk it ?
My purse !
No , it' s not worth getting killed over .
Jack . come back !
- It' s not here .
- Or at the hotel .
I looked .
- So I do like magician ...
- Yeah , you' re the midget Houdini !
Dinero ?
Jack ?
I had everything in that bag .
My passport , my credit cards ...
Thanks for doing this .
You' re bleeding to death , and I' m crying about my MasterCard .
- I apologise for being a jerk .
- What do you mean ?
I' m the jerk .
I was only trying to impress you .
For future reference , the living interest me more than the dead .
I suppose that' s quite healthy .
I suppose we should call the Cancun police on the radio .
It' s not working .
We have to head further out .
Sail to Morocco . for all I care .
It' s beautiful out here .
- How are we doing ?
- Still no dice .
I' m just going down below .
I won' t be a minute .
- Maybe we' re not out far enough .
- No . this should do it .
Tonight' s been so out of control , huh ?
Don' t take this the wrong way , but this isn' t exactly my style .
I thought you liked taking risks .
Yes , but you know what I mean .
You know ... first date . sex . one- night stand .
That so of ting .
- You' re the relationship kind ?
- Absolutely .
Both times .
- So when was the last time ?
- 1933 .
I see .
Who was he ?
A college boyfriend ?
I bet he was the captain of the drinking team .
- Wasn' t ready for a relationship .
- I wish I had been that lucky .
No , it was my shrink , actually .
You know the story .
I thought I was lonely , and ... ... he forgot he was married .
But it didn' t last very long .
And then my mom developed Alzheimer' s . so it was ...
You know what ?
I' m going to shut up right now !
- It' s okay .
- It' s me who can' t bear to hear it .
Sorry .
I' m rambling because I' m a Iittle nervous .
- You want a drink ?
- Yes , thank you .
So . what' s this for ?
- It' s for ... shark fishing .
- Shark fishing ?
With a silencer ?
Yeah .
- You certainly know your ordnance .
- In Colorado you grow up with guns .
So ... who are you , Jack ?
Who am I ?
Who am I ?
I' il tell you who I am !
I' m Captain America meets Albert Schweitzer !
Isn' t that what you always wanted ?
Yes .
I remember ...
Butch . eautiful . brilliant ...
Spends all day dashing into the fray , fists flying ...
Sorry , I don' t know any ...

How did I get here ?
Fishermen found you .
They brought you here .
You were very lucky .

- Three days .
Try not to talk .
We found a man' s wallet filled with money , but ...
- No . no ... he ...
- No . we ouldn' t find him .
There was a disk .
A green square , plastic .
Oh , yes ...
The disk was ruined by the sun .
- You relax now , and get well .
- No .
I need ...
- You haven' t got the strength .
- My clothes .
How much do I owe you ?
- Please , you have to relax now .
- No , I need my clothes .
I have to go .
I just need my clothes .
I have to go .
I just need my clothes .

But as I' ve told you 1 , 000 times , I had everything stolen .
- She' s got no passport .
- I had a temporary one .
- I don' t think they do that .

Here it is ...
It' s just under a different name .
- They think I' m not me .
- Is this your signature ?
- I just signed with another name .
- That' s a federal offence .
- Then what is it to steal a house ?
- Mike , you want to run this ?
But they' ve screwed with my information and my fingerprints ...
Who' s " they " ?
Do you work around here ?
I work in my house , but my office is in San Francisco .
You' ve lived here for four years , and no one can vouch for you ?

Alan , just go !
I swear , I asked her for a quarter , and she gave me a telephone !
Clever girl !
Voila !
Alan , you don' t have to stay if you don' t want to .
- I' m sure that ... what' s her name ?
- Amy .
Don' t worry , it' s over .
- I' m sorry .
- Don' t be .
We' re not .
This is bizarre .
What are we even doing here ?
I just figured you' d be safe .
Great !
I' ve gone from being a self- centred asshole to " safe " .
I just figured that they couldn' t trace me to you .
- Patient records are confidential ?
- I knew I had my subtle charms ...
- You' re the only one I can turn to .
- I' il take that as a compliment .
Guess what time it is ?

No drink ?
All right , I come bearing gifts .
Some of Any' s clothes for you here .
- I' m not even me anymore .
- Hey , come here .
Look at me .
You' re freaking me !
Take a breath .
Take a pause .
If you' re not you , tell me who you think you are .
- You' re not listening .
- So somebody stole your purse ...
- I didn' t think you' d believe me .
- I do .
No . that' s not true .
I believe you' re very frightened and isolated from the human race .
- And then your father leaving ...
- My father didn' t take my car !
He didn' t sell my house , get the police after me or try to kill me !
I believe something happened , but that doesn' t make sense .
I don' t want to be simplistic , but you' re just reaching out ,
Yes !
I' m reaching out to anyone who knows me . will listen to me . - - and be my friend .
Someone I can trust ...
I' m sorry .
It' s easier for me to play doctor than to listen .
I don' t understand .
Why me ?
I' m nobody .
They knew everything .
What I ate and drank . what movies I watched . - - where I was from . what cigarettes I used to moke ...
They must watch the internet .
Our whole lives are on computer .
They knew I could be " vanished ' " and no one would care .
- It' s okay .
What can I do ?
- Put my mom somewhere else .
Put her under a different name .
You can do that . as a doctor ?
Sure .
I can put your mom in the county sanitarium .
How' s that ?
It would mean a lot .
She' s all I' ve got left .
Christ , Angie !
They' ve really gotten into your head with this .
Put yourself in my shoes .
Suddenly you ring with this convoluted story .
Listen , I don' t buy the whole story , but I have a friend in the FBl ...
No !
I' m running from the police .
That' s the last thing I need .
Well then , why don' t you just live the rest of your life in this hotel ?
- Do you trust him ?
- I went with him to frat parties .
- I' m serious .
Do you trust him ?
- Yeah .
I trust Ben .
I do !
Now I' il go and figure out how to transfer your mom to the sanitarium .
Then I' il call Ben .
If I get any information , I' il call .
Don' t be so down .
It' il be okay , I' m on watch now .
This would never have happened if you' d stayed with me .
Alan ?
Thank you ... for everything .
You' re welcome .
You stay put , kiddo .
Welcome to the Swiss nternet !

BOB FOX
Hi .
Bob Fox ?
They killed Dale .
Now they think I have the programme .
First you say someone tried to kill you , then Dale ?
- And they put someone in my place .
- Why would anyone do all this ?
They would want someone at Cathedral to overwrite the programmes .
And you can' t do that from outside .
You know Devlin' s internet number ?
I plugged it in , and got into Michael Bergstrom' s medical files .
- The guy who blew his head off ?
- A computer said he had AlDS .
But when they did the autopsy , there was no HlV .
- If you' re dead , you get the truth .
- I' m starting to believe you .
I need to go to Cathedral and find " Mozart' s Ghost " .
They' ve got an echo system that can re- trace all your keystrokes ...
Are you all right ?
Pull over .
You' re scaring me .
- The pills ...
- What pills ?
We' il go to the hospital .
He' s okay , isn' t he ?
He' s allergic to penicillin .
He' s being intubated .
- I have no idea what you just said .
- He' il be fine .
You can see him .
I would like that .
Thank you .
Hi .
How do you feel ?
I' m starving .
When you get out , I' il cook you the best microwave meal you' ve ever had .
- How long will they keep me here ?
- Just another day .
And will you be handling the out- patient care , nurse ?
Well , do you mind ?
Visions of sponge baths dance in my head .
I' ve got to go .
Are you going to be okay ?
I' il be fine .
I wish it was over , but I' il be fine .
Come here .
I want to tell you somethig .
Come close .
I wanted to do that since yesterday .
When you get better , I might let you do it again .
- Do you still think I' m crazy ?
- Sure I do .
I always have .
Want to dance ?
Come on , give Benny a big hug !
Come on back here !
It' s safer to stay right here .
Sorry , Bob couldn' t make it .
- Is that how to greet an old lover ?
- You' re not one .
I' m surprised you didn' t kill me , then fuck me !
It was difficult . because I was attracted to ou .
I still am .
I' m going to attract the police if you don' t go away .
You' ve been avoiding them since you ran away .
They' d be interested to hear how you killed Dale and came after me .
Go ahead !
They' il be happy to make your acquaintance .
Did you know that Ruth Marx has a criminal record for drugs - - and prostitution ?
You' ve got quite a record .
Like Bergstrom' s ?
I know about his suicide . and about the Praetorians .
I' m sure they' d love to hear about that .
Everybody has their button .
And Bergstrom' s was homophobia .
You just have to know ... which button to push .
I don' t have your disk .

FlNGERPRlNT MATCH
BACKGROUND :
MOTHER DEAD FROM OVERDOSE
I want to help you , but what you' re saying is so far- fetched .
They changed your name , medical records , crashed planes .. ?
Just think about it .
Our whole world is sitting there on a computer .
Everything .
Your car records , your social security , - - your credit cards , your medical history .
It' s all there .
Like a little electronic shadow just begging to be screwed with .
- Today it' s me , tomorrow it' s you .
- Look .
Miss Marx ...
I' m not Ruth Marx .
They put her on your computer .
I hate to tell you this , but all the police computers - - have for the last six months been protected by " Gatekeeper " .
So nothing that you' re describing could possibly happen .
Oh my God , it' s the programme .
Gatekeeper has a flaw .
If they changed my identity , the Praetorians must know !
Then that solves it .
- Where did you get the stolen car ?
- Okay , listen to me .
It' s like a Trojan horse , this thing , the Praetorians .
They hack into computers and cause chaos .
LAX , Wall Street , the Department of Water and Power in Atlanta ...
They do it so that people buy this programme for security .
Only to find out they' ve given the Praetorians access to the system .
Imagine what they can do with this power .
- This is fascinating , Miss Marx .
- Please , my name is Bennett .
Write it down , if you want .
B- E- N- N- E- T- T.
- Why would I make this up ?
- I' m your appointed attorney .
I' m obligated to do as you wish .
I' il call you Cleopatra if you want .
But if you go before the judge with this craziness . - - you will be found incompetent to stand trial - - and they will hold you indefinitely .
Hi .
Yeah , this is her daughter .
Hi Mom .
It' s me .
Are you doing okay ?
How' s that new nurse treating you ?
It' s Angela , Mom .
It' s Angela .
Mom . listen .
I need you to do something for me .
There' s a lady here ...
She' s going to take the phone , and you tell her that I' m me .
Because she doesn' t believe me .
Can you tell her that , Mom ?
Mom . don' t .
Are yo there ?
I just want you to know that I love you .
Lady ?
What ?
Who' s come to get me ?
Special Agent Ben Phillips , FBl .
I' m Alan' s friend .
- Terrible , what happened to him .
- I' m so glad that you' re here .
As soon as I heard your story I had half our agents chasing this down .
Beating every bush , trying to find you .
Sorry it had to be here .
- Me too .
- Let' s get out of here .
- There' s an office 40 minutes away .
- And then what ?
Then I' m going fishing for a shark named Jack Devlin .
Know him ?
He' s a one- man dirty- duty squad .
Efficient and lethal .
The moral conscience of a chainsaw .
But the guys behind him are worse .
- The Praetorians .
- We' ve been chasing them for years .
But we have to move A. S. A. P .. so sketch me a quick backgroud .
How the hell did you access their system in the first place ?
I didn' t , a programmer at Cathedral sent a disk to me .
A goddamn disk !
That' s what started all this up .
Did you make a copy of the disk before it was ruined in Mexico ?
- No .
- Damn !
That disk is our only hope ofcatching these bastards .
- Did you give any copies away ?
- You are amazing sons of bitches .
How did you know it was ruined ?
I only told Devlin that .
You' re not even FBl .
But it doesn' t matter .
Ever since I got that disk I' ve gone from one nightmare to the next .
- But now I' m tired of it .
- Get off the gas !
You' re gonna kill us .
My seat belt !
