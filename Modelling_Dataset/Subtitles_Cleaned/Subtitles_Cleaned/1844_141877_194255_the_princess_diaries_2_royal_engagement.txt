- [.] Kissing children .
Hugging orphans .
What a vulgar , low , despicable , political trick .
Carolina .
Would you like to be a princess today ?
I can' t , I' m too little .
Too piiccola .
Oh , no .
Because I declare that anyone can be a princess today .
Well , why don' t we get you a tiara , and you can wave , and march in the parade ?
In fact , why don' t you all take tiaras ?
All ?
Give them all free tiaras ?
- I' il take care of it later .
- Thank you .
- ( giirl ) Yo quiiero una verde .
- ( giirl # 2 ) I want a silver one .
You won' t be able to wave with your thumb in your mouth .
- I can wave with this hand .
- Very good .
- ( giirl ) I want the purple one .
- ( boy ) I want a crown .
- ( boy # 2 ) Can we be in the parade ?
- Of course , of course .
We could always use more princes in the world .
OK , so ...
To be a princess , you have to believe that you are a princess .
You' ve got to walk the way you think a princess would walk .
So think tall , you gotta smile , and wave , and just have fun .
- So are you ready ?
- Yes .
Ah , she' s letting the children join her .
How charming .
Not for everyone .
Drumroll , please .
( shouts ) Give the princess a drumroll .
( drumroll ) ( Kelly ) Forward ... march !

This has been Elsie Kentworthy and former Miss Genovia , Hildegaard Huffman , at the best lndependence Day parade Genovia' s seen in years .
Thanks to Princess Mia' s special surprise .
May the rest of your day be sunny- side up .
( Miia ) And so , gentlemen , the children from the shelter will be housed at the winter castle in the mountains of Libbet .
The use of the castle as a resort is sort of a perk for parliament members and dignitaries .
- Exactly .
- Oh .
Well , I' m going to de- perk it , and convert it into a children' s shelter until money can be raised for one of their own .
I feel guilty having two homes while they have none .
( whiispers ) We' re going to have to do something .
Where are we gonna ski ?
Lord Crawley , how is your brother doing ?
- I don' t speak to my brother .
- Oh .
Well , I' ve hired him to be the architect on the project .
- Mr. Crawley .
- Your Highness .
Gentlemen .
- Jerry .
- Dean .
Well , I look forward to getting your notes on these plans .
But no one else' s .
- Oh , I' il give you notes , because I' m part ...
- Oh , no , you won' t .
I' m an architect .
- I am part of this parliament .
- Oh , you just go skiing ...
- So what if I go skiing ? - ... and you like to be an outdoorsman .
- Oh , and you' re a couch potato .
- Outdoorsman .
- You' re a couch potato .
- Outdoorsman .
- Couch potato .
Couch potato .
- Outdoorsman .
Outdoorsman .
- Couch ...
- ( knockiing )
The queen approves of the plan , and I intend to see it through .
Now , gentlemen , I don' t think it' il take too long to raise the money .
Do you ?
We' re setting up the ramp in the ballroom .
OK .
- Hello .
- Hello .
My hello' s insignificant .
Rosencrantz , Guildenstern , come with me .
So .
- Are you crashing my bridal shower ?
- Sadly , no .
I wanted to tell you that I was very impressed by what you did at the parade .
Thank you .
I' m having a slumber party .
Congratulations on the children' s center .
- Thank you .
Thank you .
- That' s wonderful .
- She needs to get ready for the party .
- She' s busy .
Lenny , Squiggy , zip it .
Lilly ?
The princesses are arriving .
- Well , I should go and read my book .
- I should go and get changed .
Yeah .
- That' s it .
- Bye .
Hello , hello .
Elsie Kentworthy here .
Weeks before her wedding , Princess Mia , in a stroke of skilled diplomacy , has invited royal princesses from all over the world to her bridal shower slumber party .
Hello , Princess Lorraine .
- Oh , braces .
- Yeah .
I' m getting two diamonds put in .
Oh .
That must make it more comfortable .
Hi , Charlotte .
Princess Aimee of Mallorca .
- Is this my party ?
- No , this is Princess Mia' s party .
Oh .

( Miia ) So I want thank you all very much for my fabulous bridal shower presents .
And now , I have a present for you .
It' s time for mattress surfing !

I think I' il just have some milk and cookies in my room , Olivia .
- Yes , Your Majesty .
- Perhaps some earplugs .
- Quite a party , darling .
- Yeah .
We' re just having a little bit of fun .
Oh , Rupert and the boys used to love doing that .
King Rupert .
May he rest in peace .
I did it too , you know .
But a little differently .
Felix ?
- I thought you never slide .
- I don' t .
But I' ve done a lot of flying in my time .

Is she really going to do this ?

Ha !
Ta- da .

# Just to pass the time away
# Can' t you hear the bells a- ringing ?
# Rise up so early in the morn
# Can' t you hear the bells a- shouting ?
# Maids , go do your chores
And now , to end our little show , if we all give her a shout- out ,
Her Majesty may sing us a song .
Thank you , no .
Queens rarely do karaoke .
Grandma , come on .
The song you sang at my 1 8th- birthday party .
- Remember that ?
They loved it .
- Dear , we had music then .
Mia had a CD made , so you can sing along .
Clarisse , Clarisse ,
Clarisse , Clarisse , Clarisse ...
Some girls are fair , some are jolly and fit .
Some have a well- bred air , or a well- honed wit .
# Each one' s a jewel , with a singular shine
# A work of art with its own rare design
# Dear little girl , you are terribly blessed
# But it' s your heart of gold I love the best
# And that will be your crowning glory
# Your whole life through
# It' il always be your crowning glory
# The most glorious part
- # Of you - ( # r& b beat )
What did you do ?
Well , I might have tweaked it a little bit on my computer .
But I don' t know how to do this sort of thing .
Asana , now .
Grandma , just follow Asana and sing . - # Some boys can walk - # Some guys can groove
- # Strike an elegant pose - # Wear the really hip clothes

# Call you more lovely than others by half
- # The one who' s right - # My gorgeous prince
- # Will be honest and true - # He' il believe in me too
# And prize your heart of gold the way I do
# He' il know that that will be your crowning glory
# Your whole life through
# Your love will see that it' s your crowning glory

( Mabrey ) Gretchen , hot water .
- What are you saying ?
- Well , she' s smart .
And she really cares about Genovia .
Maybe ...
Well , maybe it wouldn' t be so bad if she ran the country .
Are you mad ?
She believes in Genovia so much that she' s convinced herself to marry someone that she knows she can never love .
I can' t believe that I am hearing this .
You want her to rule ?
After all the effort that we have put in , to end up with nothing ?
It wouldn' t be nothing .
Genovia would be in good hands , and she would be happy .
Ah .
You' ve fallen in love with her .
No .
No , Uncle , all that I' m asking ...
No , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , you listen .
What do you think will happen ?
That she will leave Andrew and marry you ?
I put in the effort to make you a king , not to have you marry a queen .
I will not have it , sir .
Don' t worry , Uncle .
That will never happen .
Mia doesn' t care for me that way .
Oh , but you care for her .
Uncle , I just want us to stop trying to sabotage her .
That' s all .
All right .
If that' s what you really want .
I just want your happiness , my boy .
Go to her .
Congratulate her .
And tell her that we surrender .
Thank you , Uncle .
Elsie Kentworthy , please .
( coughiing )
That' s enough flaming ones for now .
Are you sure I didn' t burn you ?
- ( Liilly ) Of course you did .
Look at his coat .
- No , no , it' s very minor .
You just sort of seared the sleeve .
Look .
( Miia ) Sorry .
( Niicholas whiistliing Rachmaniinoff )
- Lilly ?
- Yes ?
- Can I talk to you for a second ?
- Uh- huh .
Look over there .
Should I shoo him ?
Should I shoo him ?
Just tell me who I should shoo and I' il shoo .
I just want to talk to Nicholas for a second .
OK .
- Backing off , please .
Andrew ?
- Yes ?
Why don' t you go introduce Lilly to your parents ?
You know , just tell them I' il be up for brunch in a second .
( Liilly ) Yeah , I' d love to meet Susan and Arnold .
We can have those tasty finger sandwiches together .
Would you like some help ?
He' s not the one she' s marrying , is he ?
Would you please try to keep up , Brigitta ?
He' s trying to steal the crown .
- Ready ?
- Mm- hm .
- Take your stance .
- OK .
Elbow down .
Just a bit .
Use your mouth as an anchor .
- Excuse me ?
- Touch your mouth .
Good .
Relax this hand .
And breathe in .
Release .
Oh .
How did that feel ?
Wonderful .
Wonderful .
Turn around .
We should give them some privacy .
I have to go .
I really only came back to pack my things .
You' re leaving ?
I think it' s time I bowed out gracefully .
Don' t you ?
Goodbye .
- Bye .
- Goodbye .
Mia .
Could I see you one more time before I go ?
Nicholas , I' m watched like a hawk .
Princess , Princess .
See ?
I' il find a way .
Yes ?
Um , nothing .
I' m just supposed to watch you .
( crashiing and clatteriing )
With only two and a half days left , Olivia , I' m beginning to feel rather frantic .
Would you take Maurice out for me , please ?
I have to check the orchestra selections .
And they asked you to approve a place setting for the reception , Your Majesty .
Very well .
( woman' s voiice ) Our selectiions for danciing at the royal receptiion .
( # waltz musiic )
( chuckles )
Have you been thinking about us ?
Yes , I have .
I see .
If you' il excuse me .
No , Joseph .
You had to know what I was going to say .
Mia needs me now more than ever before .
It' s the monarchy .
I mean , as queen it' s my responsibility .
You know how it is .
You were never just my queen , Clarisse .
You were the someone that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with .
But , if you prefer that I see you first and foremost as my queen ...
- I shall oblige .
- No , Joseph ...
Your Majesty .
( musiic stops )
Your bed is turned down , Your Highness .
If you don' t need anything else , Princess , we' re going to supper .
Oh .
Well , enjoy yourselves , ladies .
Ah- ah- ah .
What did we talk about ?
No more curtsy .
We' re going to supper .
Thank you .
- Hi , Miss Lilly .
- May we announce you ?
I can announce myself .
Lilly Moscovitz !
- Mia , look out your window .
- Why ?
What' s going on ?
Just look out your window .
Prince Charming is throwing pebbles .
Nicholas .
Nicholas , what are you doing ?
( clears throat )
Rapunzel , Rapunzel , with hair so fine .
Come out your window , climb down the vine .
The feat you ask , dear sir , isn' t easy .
And I won' t respond to that line , it' s far too cheesy .
So what does he want ?
He wants me to climb down the vine .
- Well , do you want to ?
- Yes .
- So go .
- It' s a recipe for disaster .
Mia , do something impulsive for once in your life .
You' re getting married .
Do you want a regular bachelorette party with 1 2 screaming girls , or do you want a stroll in the moonlight with your almost- Prince Charming ?
I always like a man in shades .
- Oh , Your Majesty .
- No , no , ladies .
Come in , come in .
I was just about to leave .
This really is more romantic in books .
My foot is stuck .
( thud )
Oh , what was that ?
# Frère Jacques , Frère Jacques
# Dormez- vous ?
Dormez- vous ?
Your Majesty , we never got to finish our routine at the slumber party .
And there' s more dancing , too .
# Frère Jacques , Frère Jacques
- # Dormez- vous ?
Dormez- vous ?
- ( thud )
- And there' s a big finish .
- Yes , the big finale .
( screamiing ) ( grunts of paiin )
- I' m sorry .
Did I hurt you again ?
- No , I ...
I' m used to it .
# Sonnez les matines , sonnez les matines
# Ding , dang , dong
# Ding , dang , dong
What a pity we missed it at the party .
( Liilly ) I' il cover for you .
Go , Rapunzel , go .
- ( Niicholas ) Tell me your greatest desires .
- Tell me a secret .
- lsn' t that the same ?
- Almost .
But anyone can see your desires .
No one knows what' s in your heart .
- Tell me something .
- Um ...
I love I Love Lucy reruns .
And sometimes I dream in black and white .
I used to pretend I was sick when I had a test in school .
- We all did that .
- OK .
Sometimes , I put chocolate milk on my cereal .
I am deathly afraid of jellyfish .
I haven' t danced with you since your birthday .
That' s a fact .
It' s not a secret .
The secret is , is that ...
I still want to .

Good morning .
- Good morning .
- Hello .
- We stayed out all night .
- Yes , we did .
We stayed out all night .
Is that ...
- There' s a man in that boat .
- What ?
Do you see that ?
There' s somebody over there .
He' s probably some fisherman , I suppose .
With a video camera ?
- What ?
- You' re really low .
No , Mia .
I have no idea who that man is .
You know , it' s really a shame he didn' t get juicier stuff last night , you jerk .
Mia , I have nothing to do with this .
I swear .
Mia , please .
Come on .
Will you listen to me ?
- That is not my boat .
- Hey , Nicholas ?
Have a nice life .
But that is my horse .
Mia ...
Mia ?
Hello ?
Good morning , my love .
I know it' s a little early , but I' ve been thinking .
Things have been so pressured lately .
I was wondering whether we should spend ...
Lilly ?
Good morning , Your Majesty .
- What ...
What are you doing here ?
- I just wanted ...
Mia .
Doors .
- What' s going on ?
- Princess , I think you should see this .
( Elsiie ) And here' s the royal exclusiive I promiised .
After generatiions of boriing royals who never miisbehaved ,
Genoviia fiinally has a world- class scandal .
Proviing that we should have brought iin an Ameriican long ago .
Wiill Andrew Jacoby , Duke of Keniilworth , stiill marry such a naughty , naughty priincess ?
Or wiill Lord Niicholas Devereaux be the new kiing ?
It' s out of the fryiing pan and iinto the fiire for Priincess Miia .
Keep your eggs sunny- siide up .
I' d like to tell her what she can do with her eggs ...
Lilly .
- Could we have a moment alone ?
- Yes .
So ?
I got played .
A- ha .
Well , the big question is : do we still have a wedding ?
- Andrew , I am so , so sorry .
- Excuse me .
Andrew , please wait .
I promise you nothing happened .
Yes , but Mia , you still went , didn' t you ?
You went .
I don' t think you understand .
I' m an extremely eligible bachelor in England .
I really am .
I' ve got plenty of friends , lots of lovely women friends , and ...
I still think this marriage is a good idea .
Mia .
( cow moos )
The queen would not approve of spying .
Ah .
So ?
Anything ?
I really want to say yes , but no .
There' s just , there' s no ... spark .
Me too .
- Really ?
- Really .
- I mean , it was pleasurable .
- Very .
- Very pleasant , but , but , but no fireworks .
- None .
What are we gonna do ?
Look , we will ...
We will figure something out .
Mia .
You chose me .
No privacy .
You chose me , and I accepted .
And a gentleman never backs out on his word .
We are going to ...
We' re going to stand up in church and say " I do , " and tomorrow we' il be man and wife .
And you are going to make an amazing queen of Genovia .
Thank you .
I' m getting married today .
( Clariisse ) She' s getting married today , Maurice .
Your Highness , we' re running very late .
Grandma says the queen is never late , everyone else is simply early .
Your Highness , a strange woman came in and said that she wanted to hide in your closet .
So I let her .
Well , dear , that probably wasn' t the wisest decision in the ...
Now , this is what I call a closet .
- Mom .
- Oh , my darling .
- Careful .
We' re squashing Trevor .
- Hi .
Hi , Trevor .
He' s sleeping .
Shh .
He is the most beautiful baby brother .
We were joking .
We knew it was your mother .
Your stepfather' s here too .
Now , I' m your mother , it' s your wedding day , I have to say something .
Being married is about being yourself , only with someone else .
Thanks , Mom .
( knockiing )
- How are you feeling ?
You look beautiful .
- I' m ...
Well , I' m ...
- You look so calm .
- I' m a little ...
Paolo is back to turn a caterpillar into a butterfly .
- There she go , butterfly .

A wedding look for the bride .
I look like a moose .
Yes , but a very cute moose .
Make all the boy moose go ... ( honks )
I have antlers .
( honks )
Go .
I look like a poodle .
That' s just the way I feel .
Here we go again .
Good .
Sit up .
She kind of does look like a poodle .
I like it .
This time I' m so sure , I use my own pictures .
So .
Un , deux , troiis .
( Mabrey ) Gretchen ?
I can' t find my gloves .
You go on .
I think it would be better if I didn' t go to the wedding .
My boy .
Don' t give up so easily .
Come to church .
Sweep her off her feet .
In a week or two , she' il be yours .
The game is over , Uncle .
She' s going to marry Andrew .
Ah , you' re so right .
Ah , well .
This is a disaster in the making .
Wouldn' t miss a moment of it .
I' il try to catch the garter .
( shouts ) The royal carriage approaches .
- What did he say , Artie ?
- The princess is coming .
Showtime .
Suki Sanchez here from the USA .
A long way from home , but happily following a story that started in the streets of San Francisco , and is about to have a happy ending here in the small , beautiful land of Genovia .
Prepare for the arrival of Princess Mia .
Psst .
Sir .
I don' t mean to talk out of school , but there' s something you must know .
Your uncle called Elsie and set you up with that video .
Why doesn' t that surprise me ?
I should have known .
He' s up to something .
He was much too delighted that you aren' t going to that wedding .
- I must get to that church .
- Yes , yes , but how ?
Everything on four wheels is already rented for the wedding .
- Doesn' t matter , I' il run .
- No , no .
It' s too far .
No , no .
You' il take the bike .
The bike ?
Gretchen , what bike ?
We don' t have a bike .
Your grandfather' s bike .
- Buenas tardes , Tanya .
- Buenas tardes , su Majestad .
Aquí le presento a mii tío , que nos viisiita de Rosariio .
- Oh , how do you do , señor ?
- I do better if you and I get married .
I' m sorry .
My uncle learned his English watching the old Three Stooges movies .
Sorry .
Yes , well ...
You' re not going to believe this .
Lord Devereaux' s riding up the road on a bicycle .
( Niicholas ) Sir !
Sir , may I borrow your horse ?
Oh , he needs my horse .
( Niicholas ) My bike is yours .
How am I supposed to herd sheep with a bike ?
Outspoken American activist Lilly Moscovitz , the maid of honor , glides forward as a vision in pink .
I' m a girl who loves black and is wearing pink .
( all ) Aww .
( Elsiie ) And Duke Andrew' s little nephew , Viscount Ludlow , affectionately known as " James of the Cherub Cheeks . " comes down the aisle as the royal ring bearer .
- Hey , Joe .
- Hm ?
I just wanted to say , before I do this ...
I' m sorry you' re retiring .
- Who told you that ?
- The maids know everything .
Well , the heart does things for reasons that reason cannot understand .
You' re preaching to the choir .
( knocks )
Princess ?
Yes ?
And you should know that Nicholas did not set you up at the lake .
- Are you sure ?
- The maids know everything .
We' re ready when she is .
( organ musiic starts )
( audiience murmurs )
( musiic falters and halts )
- Is this part of the plan ?
- No .
I ... ( clears throat )
I' m going to need a minute or two .
Thank you , Your Highness .
( Elsiie ) Now the bride is moving swiftly back up the aisle and out the door .
- Let me .
- ( Elsiie ) Not the traditional route .
( woman ) Princess Mia !
- Princess Mia !
- Mia !
- Helen .
- Honey , I' il be right back .
I gotta change Trevor' s diaper .
Please , be seated .
There' il just be a momentary interlude .
Thank you .
- Do we rush after her ?
- No , we never rush .
We hasten .
- You' il take care of this ?
- Yes , yes .
Yes , just one moment .
( Clariisse ) Out of my way .
Oh , my dear .
Mia .
Oh , Grandma , I' m sorry .
I' m so sorry .
- I ...
I just need a minute .
- No .
- I can do this .
- No .
- I can' t do this .
- I know .
Darling , listen to me .
I made my choice .
Duty to my country over love .
It' s what I' ve always done , it seems .
It was drummed into me my whole life .
Now I' ve lost the only man I ever really loved .
- ( radiio ) Anyone got a 20 on Joseph ?
- I' m with the eagle and sparrow .
Mia , I want you to make your choices as a woman .
Don' t make the same mistakes I did .
Make your own mistakes .
There' il be plenty of them , believe me .
Now , you can go back into that church and get married , or you can walk away .
Whatever choice you make ,
Iet it come from your heart .
- Excuse me .
- She' s back .
( Elsiie ) The princess is reentering the church .
She' s walking down the aisle .
More like cantering down the aisle .
( musiic speeds up )
Andrew , wait .
Everyone deserves the chance to find true love , right ?
Yes .
Including us ?
Thank you .
For , for , uh ... saving me from doing the proper thing for once in my life .
Now all I have to do is tell Mummy .
I have to tell everyone else .
( both ) Good luck .
Helen .
Welcome .
A few moments ago , I realized the only reason I was getting married was because of a law , and that didn' t seem like a good enough reason .
So ...
I won' t be getting married today .
Sit .
Sit .
There may be a dinner .
My grandmother has ruled without a man at her side for quite some time , and ...
I think she rocks at it .
So as the granddaughter of Queen Clarisse and King Rupert ... ( all ) King Rupert .
May he rest in peace .
I ask the members of parliament to think about your daughters , your nieces , and sisters , and granddaughters , and ask yourselves :
would you force them to do what you' re trying to make me do ?
I believe I will be a great queen .
I understand Genoviia to be a land that combiines the beauty of the past wiith all the best hope of the future .
- Not now .
- Shh .
I feel in my heart and soul that I can rule Genovia .
I ...
I love Genovia .
Do you think that I would be up here in a wedding dress if I didn' t ?
I stand here , ready to take my place as your queen .
Without a husband .
( woman ) Viiva Miia !
Every time ...
Every time this charming young lady opens her mouth , she demonstrates a contempt for the customs of Genovia .
The law clearly states an unmarried woman cannot be queen .
Fortunately , there is another heir .
No , there is not .
I decline .
I refuse to be king .
Ladies and gentlemen , it is Princess Mia who should have the crown .
She' s bright , and she is caring .
But more importantly , she has a vision .
One that will take Genovia forward , and if the parliament were astute , they would name her queen .
Listen to her .
She' il lead us into the 21 st century .
And besides , just think how lovely she' il look on our postage stamp .
Lovely on a postage stamp ?
You would look lovely on a postage stamp !
Don' t you walk away from me , sir !
You have a duty , sir , to Genovia .
He' s , uh ... he is very distressed .
Your duty , sir , to the country !
To me , sir !
To Genovia !
For your father !
Nicholas !
- The door .
- Shut the doors , quickly .
Nicholas .
Nicholas !
Nicholas , I cannot have you giving all , all this up just for a girl .
