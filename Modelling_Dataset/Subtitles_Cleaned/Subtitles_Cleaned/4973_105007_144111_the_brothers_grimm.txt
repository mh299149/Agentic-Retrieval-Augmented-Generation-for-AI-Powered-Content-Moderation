- [,] Very well , you shall return to the forest
But I warn you attempt to escape ..
And I shall raze every tree demolish every building ..
Slaughter every innocent in search for you
You understand ?
Mind his head
Take as much as you can carry , alright ?
Who exactly is our outfit with ?
The one closest to you on a horse
Jake , jake , listen
Get back on your horse Move ! Move !
Wait , I remember the rest of the story
What are you talking about ?
It' s an ancient folklore It' s been passed down
Jake !
They tortured and killed her ancestors
To get their hands on the spell
Give me that stupid book !
Jake , you gotta understand something
This is not about the story It' s about you and her
You want to rescue her - What' s wrong with that ?
She' s part of the story
She' s still there , isn' t she ?
The queen , she' s been in the tower for centuries now
Waiting for someone
To serve her ?
To scare the children ?
Now that' s not the truth , Angelica I know it believe it
Ignore him , he wishes his old life was something out of a book
And now he thinks he' s in love
Shut upWill !
Angelica , leave the village now
I will , but I' m gonna find my sisters
Will doesn' t care about them
Will doesn' t care about anything but himself !
It' s a fairy tale !
They' re not coming back !
It' s not your worldWill !
Angelica , you know , don' t you ?
The story' s happening to us now
We' re living it It' s alive , it' s real !
We can give it a happy ending
Angelicawe' il find your sisters
We' il bring them back
Bring back her sisters ?
Bring them back with what ?
Magic beans ?
They would not bring people back
They did not then And they would not now !
You go wait by the horses !
Jacobwait by the horses !
Sorry
We' il do what he thinks is rightWill
He' s trying to help
We cannot fight the entire forest
You' re just scared - Just scared ?
I' m terrified You should be too
Don' t you understand ?
The idea of going back in there
Nothing makes sense there ..
Like being inside Jake' s head
God , I hate him He makes me so mad
He should be whipped , doesn' t he ?
The thing is , I can' t -- - Protect him
My father' s gonna protect his family too
Jake .. Jake , come back
Jake ! Come back , Jake !
You' re a fool !
Now do you see ?
I made that armour
It' s not magic It' s just a shield
This lovely fraulein will end up as a cartress
It' s alright , just go Go !
It' s only a snap ..
More tension in the snap ball
Put the trunks up here now , please
Is the trunk secure ?
- Yes , it' s secure
So , if we find these 11 girls ..
Those villagers think they were actually devoured by the forest
And what exactly do we think ?
Alright , get into position ..
