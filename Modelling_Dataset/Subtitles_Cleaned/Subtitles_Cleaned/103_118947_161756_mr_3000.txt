- [t] You don' t like me because I don' t sign autographs .
You don' t like me because I don' t smile for the camera .
You don' t like me because I don' t suck up to the press .
You don' t like me because I make a lot of money .
But you love me .
Because I' m one of the greatest hitters alive .
We' re back in Milwaukee , and the sound you hear reverberating across the cities and farms of the great state of Wisconsin is the roar of the Brewer faithful for their longtime hero , Stan Ross .
And here he comes with that trademark arrogant scowl .
2, 999 hits to date in his illustrious career .
Will this at- bat , July 29 , 1995 , against the rookie right- hander Billy Earil , be the historic moment when Ross joins only 20 other major leaguers in that elite 3, 000- hit club ?
Stan .
You' re gonna be the best- looking cat in the Hall of Fame , that' s for doggone sure .
Yo , scrub !
You want my autograph now or after I make history ?
You ain' t getting this hit off me .
This is gonna be your one career highlight .
You' re gonna be a game- show answer .
Well , I' il take " Kiss my Ass " for $1, 000 .
Make it 3, 000 .
You hear that language on that rookie ?
Kiss my ass .
How about you , Ernie ?
You' re gonna tell me to kiss your ass , too ?
Why don' t you suck my ...
I' il show you what kiss my ass look like .
I' il show him .
I' il put up this ...
Damn it , Joe !
He know better than to get me pissed off !
No pitcher wants to be the one that gives up that 3, 000th base hit .
Clearly Earil just sent that message .
A purpose pitch to get Ross angry .
Come on , this is the one .
You know what I' m talking about !
Hope he trips and breaks his leg .
Uhh !
Oh , my !
It' s a vicious line drive off Earil' s ...
Well , it' s a bell- ringing base hit .
That' s what it is .
Stan Ross is safe at first .
Hey , Coach , get me that ball .
That' s the ball that got me to the Hall of Fame .
- You want this ball , Ross ?
- Yeah .
Thanks , man .
There goes your damn ball .
You see that , Coach ?
You see what he just did ?
He threw my Hall of Fame ball in the stands .
What' s your problem ?
- Back up .
Back up .
- Move , man !
You be out when I get back , or someone will have to pull a piece of baseball history out the crack of your ass !
- What you looking at ?
- Make a move .
Okay , I' il shrink your big ass .
You' il get some , too .
You saw what he did , Coach .
All right , guys .
That ain' t gonna mean nothing .
Get back in .
Who got my ball ?
Open that gate .
All right !
He' s coming on up .
Hey , congratulations , Stan !
Give me my ball .
- What ?
- What' d he say ?
Give me my 3, 000- hit ball .
Don' t look at your daddy .
Give me my ball !
Whoa , make him a trade at least .
Give him your cap or an autographed bat .
- I' m not trading him !
- Hey , whoa !
What the ...
Are you all right , pal ?
Why don' t you take his cotton candy while you' re at it ?
Were you glad to get number 3, 000 here in Milwaukee ?
Sure .
You ask any of the all- time greats , man .
We all got a special connection with our hometown fans .
What connection did you make with that kid who caught the ball tonight ?
What you talkin ' about ?
People in that section say you threatened him .
I gave him good advice .
What the hell wrong with you people ?
I just became a legend like Willie Mays ,
Stan Musial , and Carl Yastrzemski .
Y' all gonna try to speak on something negative ?
That' s what I' m talkin ' about .
That' s why I' m quittin ' .
- What ?
- What ?
What do you mean , quitting ?
Quittin ' .
I' m done .
Hangin ' it up .
Now that I got this , I ain' t playin ' no more .
And that means no more talking to you stank- ass reporters .
- Excuse me ?
- That' s right .
I' m talking to you .
And I said " stank- ass . "
Why now with the Brewers still in the race ?
Couldn' t you wait until after the season ?
I' d have quit last season if I didn' t think you were gonna try to block me from the Hall of Fame .
But it don' t matter ' cause I got mine .
3, 000 .
Like it or not , I' m a certified immortal .
And there ain' t nothin ' you sons of bitches can do about it .
Nothin ' .
Attention , all Milwaukee leprechauns .
Hey , all you Milwaukee leprechauns .
This is St. Patty' s Day .
Get your shamrock groove on at Stan Ross ' Mr. 3000 Sports Bar ,
located on Peacock Street in Waukesha County .
We got 3, 000 different kind of beers .
We got Wild Irish Rose and anything that you might want .
But wait .
There' s more .
You want to get that heavy vibration from that special someone ?
Get your page on at 3000 Beeps .
Get your hair dyed , fried , and laid to the side at 3000 Cuts .
Knickknack patty- whack , get your dog a bone .
And get your woof on at 3000 Paws .
Get your Szechuan feast on at 3000 Woks .
Bring the whole family down to Mr. 3000 Shopping Center .
First year , I was 150 votes short .
Come here .
Second year , I was less than 50 and so on .
Last year , I was just 4 votes away .
Sportswriters hate me .
But my numbers don' t lie .
I got 3, 000 up there , one for each one of my hits .
They gotta let me in .
It' s my year , and everybody knows it .
What about him ?
Who' s that ?
You know who that is .
That' s T- Rex Pennebaker .
Best player on the Brewers .
T- Rex Pennebaker ain' t nothin ' .
I don' t even know why you bother learning his name , especially what you got in front of you , a living legend .
A certified immortal .
And I know you don' t know a lot of immortals .
Hey , easy , old man .
Old man ?
What you mean is " aged , " like U. S. D. A. Beef .
It' s what' s for dinner .
Not on my plate .
- No ?
- No .
Monstrous .
Just ain' t like the old days , huh , Boca ?
Mnh- mnh .
- Wow .
- Spring training .
You can practically smell the grass , can' t you ?
Can' t say I can , man .
What , you don' t miss it ?
Miss it ?
Nah .
Nah .
Stan didn' t make many friends when he was playing here .
He wasn' t very good with the press .
We invited him to Old- timers ' Day every year since he retired .
That' s nine years .
And he never RSVP' d once .
He might not want to do this , you know what I' m saying ?
No .
What are you saying ?
I' m just saying , " Stan Ross Day . "
Retire his number .
The fans , man .
Did he go for it ?
Did you hit him with the fans bit ?
How about where you say you didn' t know if I would do it ?
Boca , I swear , when you get to going , you can talk a stripe off a zebra .
Monstrous .
And welcome to beautiful Miller Park .
Ladies and gentlemen , we' re here today to retire number 21 , worn by one of the Brewers ' all- time greats .
Seven times an All- Star , a member of that exclusive 3, 000- base- hit club , the Wizard of Wood , the Count of Contact , and the King of the Swing ,
Milwaukee' s own Mr. 3000 , Stan Ross !
Wow !
Damn !
I still look good .
He hasn' t lost his touch , has he ?
And joining us today to pay tribute to Stan ,
let' s welcome former teammate Bill " Big Horse " Berelli .
Who ?
I think he played with you a couple of months in ' 79 .
He was a middle reliever .
What happened to Paul Molitor , man ?
Robin Yount ?
Cecil Cooper ?
What happened to them ?
They declined .
We' re lucky we got him .
You know , a lot of people said that Stan only looked out for himself .
That he wasn' t a team player .
But I' m here to tell you that if you get 3, 000 hits , you don' t have to be a team player .
What ?
If you have a lifetime . 314 average , you don' t have to be a good guy .
If you lead the league in batting for three years , you can be the biggest jerk in the world .
He laughin ' , man .
He laughin ' .
So on behalf of all of us who played alongside of you , congratulations .
Go on , go on , man .
You can' t help me now .
Also here with us today , you remember him well , number 8 , Anthony Carter .
All right , come on .
Tell them like it is , Boca .
Come on , baby .
Now we' re talkin ' .
Me and Stan were teammates .
Man , could he hit the ball .
Tell ' em , baby .
And I loved him for that .
I love you more .
That' s it ?
I' m trying to get enshrined .
That' s it ?
Man , y' all killin ' me , man .
All right , Milwaukee ,
let' s hear it for our Brewers ' own Stan Ross !
Thank you so much .
First , I want to thank you , Mr. Schembri , and the entire Milwaukee Brewers organization .
And to my main man , my best friend , Boca Carter .
And to you , Old Donkey .
- Big Horse !
- Whatever !
But most of all , I want to thank you- all .
The fans .
You were always there for me .
And I know for a fact , if it was up to you ,
I' d have been in the Hall of Fame a long time ago .
But unfortunately , it' s up to a bunch of sportswriters .
Some metalhead half- asses .
How the hell do you bat 3, 000 and not be selected into the Hall of Fame ?
What type of bullshit is that ?
Let me tell you something .
You- all believed in me when I was at my best .
You- all believed in me when I was at my worst .
You , the fans !
That' s why I know for a fact
I can depend on you- all to bring me , Stan Ross , to Cooperstown .
I can hear you say " Stan ! "
Stan !
Say " Stan Ross " !
Stan Ross !
Stan Ross !
Stan Ross !
He' s the boss !
He' s the boss !
Say " Hall of Fame " !
Hall of Fame !
It' s a damn shame !
Over here , say , " Hell , yeah " !
Hell , yeah !
Say , " Hell , yeah " !
Hell , yeah !
Say , " You' re the man " !
You' re the man !
Let me hear it again !
You' re the man !
- They love me .
- You' re the man !
You got a minute ?
Hang on .
What ?
You know how when we think somebody' s gonna be voted in , we run the numbers .
Every win , every home run , every hit ?
Yeah .
We were running that for Stan Ross .
A list of every one of his 3, 000 hits .
- There' s an error .
- One of the hits was an error ?
No , all the hits were hits .
There just aren' t 3, 000 of them .
Okay .
Start over .
Okay , there was a game in May 1982 that was called for curfew .
When they finished in August , the hits were recorded twice .
Once in May , once in August .
Stan Ross had three hits in that game .
That means that three of the hits don' t count .
- So you' re telling me ...
- Stan Ross , Mr. 3000 ,
- has only 2, 997 hits .
- 2, 997 hits .
As Yahko tried to escape across the rope bridge , he realized that he was trapped by both sides by the dreaded , evil boars .
Yahko knew his only hope was to do the unthinkable , and that was to jump far , far below into the raging , raging river .
Hold on , kids .
Hello ?
Hey ...
Hey , man , the press is eating it up .
What happens to Yahko ?
Shh , shh , shh , shh .
- What happened to Yahko ?
- What ?
- What happened to Yahko ?
- What happened to Yahko ?
Shut up !
BO Y :
I can' t believe you said that .
2, 997 ?
Man , that' s bullshit !
- Oh , Mr. Ross .
- Ooh !
- Please , the children .
- Man , hell with the kids !
Yahko' s dead !
The Hall of Fame vote is in , and Stan Ross is not .
The always- controversial ex- Brewer had slowly crept to within four votes of enshrinement , but this time finished 147 votes shy , following a correction in the record books that left him three hits short of the magical 3, 000 .
- Stan' s gonna wait - Turn it off .
Till next year to wait till next life .
From the green ...
I can' t let them do it to me .
I can' t let them take away my legacy .

You love me because I' m one of the greatest hitters alive .
# #
You love me because I' m one of the greatest hitters alive .
# #
You love me because I' m one of the greatest hitters alive .
# #
# #
# #
I' m back !
The King with the Swing , the right arm they call " The Gun , "
Stan Ross .
Nitroglycerin himself .
Number 21 , the man with sweetest swing in the major league , is back .
You gotta be joking .
How old are you ?
50 ?
47 and getting younger .
That' s why I love you , man .
Man , what the hell ?
What' s your damn problem , man ?
That was 4/ 10 of a second .
That' s how much time you have after the ball leaves the pitcher' s hand to decide whether it' s a fastball , a split- finger .
Wait , wait .
Hold on , hold on , hold on .
What you know about the game ?
You played in the majors ?
Figures .
He' s drunk .
No , I' ve just been a Brewers fan my whole life while you treated the team and the fans and the city like dirt .
Yo , Boca , get this man another bottle .
- Thank you .
- You' re welcome .
- I want you to try it again .
- What ?
' Cause last time I wasn' t standing at the plate .
Come on , try it again .
Yeah .
Boca .
See that ?
Three more of these .
Three more hits .
As I said before , Stan Ross is back .
Better talk to him , Boca .
Ladies and gentlemen , number 21 , the great , the fantastic ,
Mr. Incredible .
Stan .
I thought when we retired his number , we wouldn' t have to see that prick anymore .
MAN # 2 :
He' s a senior citizen .
Do you think I want him here ?
And he hasn' t played the game in nine years .
It' s not like we' re in the American League anymore , so he' s gotta play the field .
Can he even handle first base at his age , let alone hit ?
Fellas .
We are in fifth place , and we are not drawing flies .
And we' ve got two very long months ahead of us .
The biggest crowd we' ve had all year was the day we retired Stan' s number .
Now , we give him a physical .
Give him a month to get in shape .
Then after that September roster expansion , if he' s up to it , we put him in the lineup .
Bo , all I need is a bat .
That' s it , baby .
Look at him .
He ain' t got no waist on him .
He got nothin ' .
- Stan Ross .
- Hey .
Eddie Richling .
I' m the conditioning coach .
He here to carry you home ?
The only thing Boca gonna carry is my plaque .
- That' s why I love you .
- I love you more .
Is that right ?
How many push- ups can you do ?
One arm or two ?
Well , I' il tell you what , last time I counted , what was it , about 40 , 50 ?
I got 5 bucks in my pocket says you can' t give me 10 .
That' s easy money .
Back up , man .
- You better help your boy down .
- He didn' t help me in .
Come on , let' s see what you got .
Okay , well , that' s one .
How many is that ?
Oh , I don' t know .
I' d say 40 , 50 .
That' s four .
Come on , Stan .
You got this one .
Oh , oh !
Your knee touched , man .
- That' s a girl push- up .
- You see my knee touch ?
Well , it might have , yeah .
But who said girl push- ups don' t count ?
Yeah , who said girl push- ups don' t count ?
How you want to pay me , cash or check ?
Oh , look at them arms starting to shake .
Come on .
Come on .
Aah !
Oof !
Okay , Stan , now you ready to get started for real ?
Man , what type of shit is this ?
Hydrostatic weighing .
It' s how we determine how much body fat you really have .
I don' t need my balls washed to tell you how much I weigh .
Hold your breath , Stan .
This ain' t nothin ' but a Southern baptism .
It' s called modern technology , Stan .
Recently , the Brewers have incorporated new methods of training into their exercise regimen .
We' re gonna get you started on this bad boy .
- Look at this .
- Mm- hmm .
This looks like some punishment .
Actually , it' s very gentle .
It' s called Pilates .
Pi- what ?
Breathe in .
Okay , feel the extensors now .
I feel like Flipper .
B , that' s what I' m talkin ' about .
I' m gonna start off real light , about 463 .
You can throw 463 on if you want to , chicken chest , but your equipment is right over there .
Remember what I told you .
Keep that ass up .
All right , push !
Whoa , where you going ?
Is this a joke ?
It' s only a joke if you think weak abs are funny .
Feel it in your lats ?
You ask me about my lats .
Yeah , I feel it .
My spine and my butt , too .
Push it !
Push it !
Push it !
- Come on !
- Aah !
# #
# #
# #
# #
Whoa , where you going ?
Get back here .
# #
Whoo !
Yeah !
# #
# #
Stand up .
Sit down .
Come on , now up .
42 .
43 .
Look at this boy go .
Look at your boy .
- What' s your name ?
- Stan Ross .
- Tell ' em your name .
- Stan Ross .
- Who are you ?
- Stan Ross !
- Louder !
- They call me the boss .
- Who ?
- ' Cause I pay the cost .
- Why ?
- ' Cause I' m Stan Ross !

So , tomorrow , man , you ready ?
Game' s changed a lot since we last played .
I still see the ball .
I still hit the ball .
All day .
But I do miss playin ' .
I know I always said I didn' t , but I do .
Ain' t nothin ' like hittin ' in the major leagues .
Bein ' a part of that great tradition .
I never felt that type of respect that I felt on the ball field .
That kind of attention .
Oh , shoot , that reminds me .
You got a call this afternoon .
Some ad- agency guy from New York .
Endorsement ?
Was it Reebok ?
It' s not Reebok .
Adidas or Nike ?
Viagra .
What ?
Viagra , man .
You' d be the spokesman .
I ain' t gonna be no damn spokesman for no Viagra .
I can still swing my bat , Bo .
Are we ready to roll here ?
Okay , the Milwaukee Brewers are pleased to be able to help a member of the Brewer family reclaim his rightful place in baseball history .
So it is with great pride that I introduce to you the once and future Mr. 3000 , Stan Ross .
Thank you .
Thank you , Mr. Schembri , and the Milwaukee Brewers organization .
And I promise , it won' t be like last time when I' m in front of the microphone with all that cussin ' and shit , you know ?
- Hey , Stan .
- Yes ?
Is this only about getting back to 3, 000 hits , or do you believe you can help make the Brewers more competitive on the field ?
How could I not make them more competitive ?
Let me be a little polite here .
The Milwaukee Brewers are weak .
- Here we go .
- Who they got ?
They' re a Little League team .
You all know it .
They need me .
How do you think you' il adjust to the contemporary game ?
You ever heard of Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes ?
Earth , Wind & Fire ?
Some things just always play well .
A little " old school " is what this team needs .
- You nervous ?
- What if you don' t hit ?
What' s that ?
I said , " What if you don' t hit ? "
If all this talk is just talk and it becomes obvious you' re hurting the team , will you take yourself out of the lineup ?
I said I' m gonna hit .
When I say I' m gonna do something , I do it .
That' s not always how it works .
Well , it is for me .
Not the way I remember .
Maybe you remember something you thought I said I was gonna do , but didn' t say I was gonna do it ,
' cause I cold- blood do everything I say I' m gonna do .
Is that the way you were raised ?
Straight up and down , like 6 : 00 .
So what does your mama think about this comeback foolishness ?
Why are we getting on this Mama stuff ?
Okay , that' s it for today , folks .
Thank you very much .
Just get one more question .
Get in line .
You really nailed him on that one .
Maureen .
Hey .
What you doing here ?
What do you think ?
I' m covering the story for ESPN .
Uh- huh .
Why you , though ?
They sent me .
Just by chance , you ain' t here to see me ?
No , I' m on assignment .
They asked me to cover a story , so I' m covering it , period .
I' il see you at the ball park .
Mo , Mo , Mo , Mo .
Wait , wait .
How about an exclusive ?
See ?
You and me ?
Huh ?
You think you' il get three hits in your first three at- bats and get this thing over with ?
Come on , Mo , I' m 47 years old .
It' il probably take me maybe four at- bats .
You' re one of a kind , Stan Ross .
Thank you for sitting with us .
Good luck tonight .
Thank you .
That' s it .
Thanks , guys .
That' s a wrap .
- That wasn' t too bad , was it ?
- That was great .
After I get my hits today , you want to come by and celebrate ?
You know , you better keep your mind on the game , Mr. 3000 .
You thinkin ' , eh ?
Well , we' il see in a few hours , won' t we ?
Stan , you da man .
Livin ' legend , baby .
Yes , sir , all you got to do is walk up in there and take those youngsters to school .
Hey , oh , good .
Buddy , come here .
Help me out , please , with the zipper .
- Hey , can you give me a hand ?
- You best mean a handshake .
Wait a minute .
You' re Stan Ross .
Stan !
Stan !
Huge fan .
You gotta help me out .
You gotta unzip me .
I' m gonna tell my buddies .
" Stan Ross unzipped my pants . "
You crazy .
Oh , crazy ?
Thinkin ' I' m crazy ?
Where is he ?
Stan , Stan , Stan , Stan .
Let me tell you something .
I am crazy !
Crazy for asking you to give me a hand !
Yeah , good luck on tonight' s game .
Now , this shit is all right .
Uh- huh , sound effects could be a little bit louder when a brother hit .
That shit should sound like a cannon !
Mr. Ross .
I' m Rick , the clubhouse assistant .
Just Stan .
I' m just Stan .
All right .
That' s your locker over there .
MAN ON TELEVlSION :
The Arizona Diamondbacks and the Milwaukee Brewers .
Go ahead , man , it' s in my locker .
- I' m Stan Ross .
- I know very well who you are .
I grew up watching your excellent play on television .
You are hero to many young Japanese players .
But you have hole in your ass .
Hole in my ass ?
- What' s his problem ?
- That' s Fukuda .
He was taught English in school in Japan , but they never taught him to cuss worth a damn .
But why he cuss me out ?
I never did nothin ' to him .
Brother , you' re looking at 25 Little Leaguers in here who want to give you an ass- whupping .
Oh , 6- 3 !
6- 3 , man !
6- 4 .
You' re right , 6- 4 .
I was trying to cheat .
Minadeo , Skillett .
Second and short .
They' il go at it over anything .
What are you talking about ?
No !
That' s half out .
- It all got to be in .
- It half went in .
It has to go in , all of it .
You' re always trying to pull this .
What do you say , Grandpa ?
Does that count ?
Grandpa ?
- Here it is .
- Uh- oh .
Lineup !
Base hit , dinner' s on me .
Ah , yes !
Now batting leadoff .
Skills that pay the bills .
Whoo !
Was Panas here yet back when you were playing ?
Yeah , he was here .
I don' t think I was one of his favorites .
Stan Ross , you bat eighth !
Ha ha !
Eighth ?
That' s for banjo hitters .
Man , I never batted lower than fifth in my life .
You bat that now , you son of my dick .
Son of my dick ?
Hey , what size you swinging over there , Old School ?
34 ounce , like I always have .
You sure you can still get around with that at your age ?
Don' t you worry about me .
I' ve been swinging this thing sweet before you knew which side of the bat was the good end .
Whoo !
Yeah , I swing a 36 myself .
Yeah , that' s big talk .
I got a hammer my damn self .
Whew .
Come on , Coach .
Ross , you suck !
How' s it feel , Stan ?
How about an interview after the game ?
Come on , now , don' t distract me when I' m hittin ' .
Hitting' s my business .
- That' s what I' m talkin ' about .
- Lookin ' good , Stan .
Stan !
Still the Wizard of Wood !
Bingo .
Oh , yeah .
I' m about to take care of business .
Charge !
Charge !
Charge !
Bottom of the third , and the cheers you hear , and the boos , for that matter , are for Stan Ross .
It' s the reason most of the 38, 000- plus fans are here tonight .
MAN ON P. A :
First baseman , number 21 , Stan Ross .
This guy throws pretty hard , Pops .
Is that right ?
Well , I hit pretty hard , son .
Strike one .
Come on , Stan .
Be aggressive .
I am .
Stay focused .
Keep your eye on the ball .
I' m looking dead at it .
I don' t need you to tell me what to do .
Come on in .
I' ve been here before .
This ain' t my first picnic , baby .
Ooh , Stan was a hair off timing that big breaking ball from Hamilton .
Of course , all season , a lot of hitters , who aren' t 47 years old , have been fooled by Hamilton .
And we' re the Little Leaguers ?
Not so aggressive , baby .
Whew .
Focus .
He playin ' to you .
Let him play to you , baby .
Come on .
Come on , Stan .
Come on , baby .
Strike !
Inside fastball , and Stan Ross is out of there on three straight pitches .
It looks like it could be a long night for the King of Swing .
What up ?
Welcome to " SportsCenter . "
Stuart Scott with you .
We got some more baseball .
Braves at Brewers .
Who cares ?
Well , Stan Ross cares .
The first week at bat was a lot like the first week out of the womb for Stan .
A lot of drooling and a lot of just flailing around for the erstwhile King of Swing .
Let' s check out the highlights .
Well , Stan the man more like Stan the statue , just chillin ' at a curve for strike one .
Next pitch .
Now , wait a second .
What was it that Stan said about the rest of his team ?
The Milwaukee Brewers are weak .
Who they got ?
They' re a Little League team .
They need me .
Uh- huh .
Little Leaguers , huh ?
Well , my 9- year- old has a better swing and better eyes than that .
Oh !
Just chillin ' at a called strike three , and , well , that' il get you some halitosis action .
Yeah , when you get just a little too close to the umpire .
Stan' s not done .
He decided to do a little spring cleaning .
Either that , or he just wants to symbolize how well he' s been playing .
Yeah , garbage !
Now , I' m not gonna say that every Brewer but Stan had a hit , but I am gonna say that every Brewer but Stan that played had a hit .
Our Maureen Simmons was at the game and had postgame duty .
Not the day Stan Ross or the Milwaukee fans had in mind .
Word around the organization is that manager Gus Panas is particularly unhappy having Ross back in the lineup .
Apparently he hasn' t forgotten the way Stan abandoned the team in the middle of the pennant race nine years ago .
Stuart .
The press is having a field day .
Hey , they' re just getting even with Stan for all those years of abuse .
For turning this team into a laughingstock .
Five games and hasn' t gotten close to a hit .
How long do we let this go on ?
We got 35, 000 people in the park today .
We' re committed to this .
Whether Stan Ross ever gets another hit or not .
You sure you don' t want anything stronger than club soda ?
Oh , no , I' m good .
Thanks , Boca .
Why you call him Boca ?
Look at him .
He look like he' s ready for Boca Raton with them tracksuits .
Stan don' t appreciate my velour .
That' s all he wears .
Mo , I swear , he has a black one for funerals .
Just comin ' from me , I think my man take his old Reebok endorsement deal a little too serious .
- Hey , a lifetime supply .
- That' s why I love you .
- No , that' s why I love you .
- No , I love you more .
No , I love you more .
No , no , I started the love .
And your life' s been richer ever since .
I hear you .
Nice to see you again , Mo .
Mm , you too , Tony .
So , you hire a fancy decorator to help you do this place ?
Girl , you need to quit fightin ' .
You know doggone well you thought I was gonna be old and tired when I quit the game .
- I never thought about it .
- You thought it .
But I got news for you .
I own this place , and I own all the stores next door .
3000 Suds , 3000 Woks , and 3000 Beeps .
That' s why you' re comin ' back .
So all them names make sense .
Sister , you know why I' m comin ' back .
' Cause I deserve to be in the Hall of Fame with the immortals .
You know , you really shouldn' t word it like that .
- Is that right ?
- Mm- hmm .
- What ?
- Oh , you know what .
You better hush .
You eatin ' that steak .
Let me see something .
- Come here .
Flex .
- Mnh- mnh .
Mo , Mo , baby , look at you .
Come on , Mo .
Look at you , Mo .
Oho !
And quick still .
You gonna eat this ?
You sure got time to eat .
Baby , you hungrier than a hostage .
Ooh , take a bite out of crime .
That killed me there , I' il tell ya .
I thought the lady must have ...
Wait a minute .
Wait , wait , wait .
You don' t train no more .
You don' t drink no more .
What' s up with that ?
' Cause I remember you used to drink half the American League underneath the table .
I realized I had to start cuttin ' loose from those things that weren' t getting me anywhere .
- Where you need to be gettin ' ?
- On with my life .
We don' t stay young forever .
Come on .
You know we' re young enough .
Ooh , I don' t think so , Mr. Ross .
Come on , I know you remember what it was like .
You can' t say we didn' t have something special .
Good night .
What about Kansas City ?
That was a mind- blowing weekend .
You mean to tell me you forgot about that ?
Bye- bye .
Cleveland , when I had your toenails poppin ' off like Redenbacher .
- Bye .
- Come on , how about Toronto ?
God .
- Uh- huh .
- Oh .
- Come on , say it .
- Come on , now .
You know I didn' t expect you in Toronto .
You know how those Canadian groupies are .
- Come on , now .
- You know what ?
Don' t give me that crap .
You' re a selfish man .
You always were .
Okay , if you so upset , why was you willing to get back with me ?
We got together for a night , but I didn' t stay for breakfast , did I ?
We' d still be doin ' it if you didn' t take that ESPN gig .
When there' s a better offer on the table , you gotta take it .
I' il pay for it .
Bye- bye .
The count is 1- 1 on the second baseman Minadeo .
Brewers down by 4 .
Runner at first .
They sure could use a little spark here .
Glickman now on the mound , working from the stretch .
Throws to first and picked him off .
Skillett is caught napping .
When is this ball club going to wake up ?
Another mistake .
Minadeo steps back in .
Here' s the wind and the pitch .
Swung on , a one- hopper back to the mound .
He bobbles it , but what' s Minadeo doing ?
He' s not running .
Now they pick it up .
The throw to first , and he' s out .
- Aah !
- Come on !
Look at that .
There should be a man on first and second right now .
But easy , Gus .
Don' t get excited .
I don' t want you to pop no blood vessel .
What you- all havin ' , prayer ?
The only shining star on the team these days is their strapping young outfielder , T- Rex Pennebaker .
But even his impressive power numbers have done little to stop the Brewers ' losing streak .
Pennebaker digs in .
And here' s the windup and the pitch .
Swung on and a deep , deep drive to left field .
It' s going , going .
It is gone !
4- 1 .
Yet another bases- empty home run for T- Rex Pennebaker .
What the hell is that ?
That right there ?
That' s a little somethin ' for " SportsCenter . "
Plus , that' s gonna look tight in next year' s video game .
What the hell you call yourself doin ' ?
Yo , I' m puttin ' the show in the show .
But your team losin ' .
Instead of playin ' , you makin ' like Mr. Bojangles .
I just hit a home run , son .
Maybe you was takin ' a grandpa nap during that part .
But your team gettin ' picked off .
Your boys ain' t beatin ' out grounders .
There should' ve been two men on when you hit that homer .
It should be a ball game right now .
So yell at them , Old School .
Get up out of my face .
I did my job .
You the superstar .
You set the tone .
Listen here .
When you get a base hit in this millennium , then you can come on down there and talk to me .
Is that right ?
Yeah , that' s right .
Hey , Stan , you think that diaper' s affecting your swing ?
Maybe you should use something lighter .
How about a Wiffle bat ?
How ' bout I shove my Hall of Fame bat up the crack of your mascot ass ?
Make you a hot dog on a stick , bitch .
Yeah ?
I might be a sausage with teeth , but you sure as hell ain' t no Hall of Famer .
- # # - What ?
# #
Looks familiar ?
Familiar ?
You ain' t changed nothin ' since back in the day .
In fact , I don' t think you even vacuumed .
Well , why mess with perfection ?
Oh , I can think of a lot of descriptions for this couch , and " perfection " ain' t one of ' em .
What' s the deal there ?
How come I hardly see you on " SportsCenter " anymore ?
You know .
They got some pretty young thing they tryin ' to groom .
That' s bull .
They can' t treat you like that .
I remember once upon a time I pushed out the 40- year- old .
I been playin ' this game long enough to know how it goes .
But I' ve been lookin ' ahead toward it , you know ?
I' m gonna start producing next year .
- I' m goin ' behind the camera .
- Oh , you go , girl .
Like I' ve been telling you , you can' t beat Father Time .
Well , how come you really haven' t settled down ?
The right man wasn' t right .
# #
What' s the matter with you ?
That' s my song .
# #
Come on , bump with me .
Don' t leave me hangin ' .
Come on .
I need you , now .
Don' t leave me hangin ' .
Come on .
Come on .
Come on out here .
All right , only ' cause I like this song , too .
- Not ' cause I like you .
- I' il take it . - # # - Come on .
# #
# #
- Hey . - # #
# #
Still got it , girl .
# #
- # # - Still got it .
- Stan .
- Yeah , baby ?
Honey , stop chasing the butt .
You know what , Mo ?
The best sex I ever had was with you .
- What ?
- Yeah .
You had girls in every city in baseball .
It wasn' t the best .
Why is that ?
We do it longer ?
Not really .
More positions , then ?
I ain' t goin ' there .
Mm- hmm .
More times a night ?
Oh , you still hold the record .
I don' t know , baby .
I guess I like the rest of it .
The rest of it ?
What' s left ?
Well , you know .
I like the sleepin ' and the talkin ' and hangin ' out and stuff like that .
# #
- # # - But that' s not sex .
It is to me .
No , it' s not sex .
What you call that , then ?
# #
# #
# #
# #
# #
Before we go too far , I can' t spend the night .
- Why not ?
- Early flight .
Where you got to go ?
I got three games before we go on the road .
- But I got to get back .
- You got to get ...
Wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait .
Are you givin ' up on me , Mo ?
- What you got to say ?
- I don' t have a say .
I just go where I' m assigned .
You tell ' em I' m startin ' to swing the bat good again ?
I' m just a reporter .
I don' t make the news or decide what is the news .
- You' re givin ' up on me , too .
- Mnh- mnh .
You just got to make the news , baby .
- Start hittin ' that ball .
- Come on .
- What ?
- Come on .
You want to go up ?
Stay down ?
What ?
No .
I' m not in the mood right now .
You ...
You' re kiddin ' .
You' re not in the mood ?
- No .
- Oh , come on , baby .
No , I got a headache .
Really ?
You gonna tell me you got cramps , too ?
Maybe .
You know ...
Whatever .
All right , now .
I' m leavin ' .
Lord , just when I thought I' d seen it all .
T- REX :
When you get a base hit in this millennium , then you can come on down ...
I can still swing my bat .
You think you' il get three hits in your first three at- bats ?
More like Stan the statue .
T- REX :
When you get a base hit ...
You just got to make the news , baby .
Start hittin ' that ball .
One , two , three strikes , you' re out !
Oh , bat boy .
Ooh , ooh , a little testy .
A little testy .
Anybody have a Stan Ross rookie card ?
Quite valuable .
If you look on the back , you' il see it' s written in Latin .
You see , very old .
Very old card .
It' s on parchment .
He' s now 0- 27 in his comeback .
At what point , Peter , does the rust come off ?
I' m not sure it does .
Remember , Jim Palmer tried to come back after he was in the Hall of Fame , and he kept himself in better shape than Ross .
Why does the media hate this guy so much ?
He' s a jerk .
Because T- Rex is the best in power and performance .
Find it at Radio Shack .
Radio Shack .
You' ve got questions .
We' ve got answers .
' Cause I want my hits that got stolen from me .
Those hits are my ticket to the Hall of Fame .
He' s not going to the Hall of Fame !
You think three hits are keeping you out ?
3, 000 hits , baby , it' s automatic .
Look at me .
You' re 47 years old .
You' re fat .
You' re out of shape .
Favorite portion of the show , the comedy portion .
I' m gonna say it here , the woman that puts on the sausage outfit that races around Miller Park has got a better chance of getting a hit than Stan Ross .
That' s not fair , Tom .
He' s a black athlete .
Black athletes age slower .
George Foreman didn' t know when to get out .
Mike Tyson didn' t know when to get out .
Michael Jordan struggled , and he was only out two years .
This guy hasn' t played since I was married to my first wife .
It just isn' t possible to get out of his day .
He' s a bad teammate .
- Stan Ross was a great athlete .
- Stan is all about Stan .
The Brewers knew what they were getting into .
It' s a publicity stunt , just like when the White Sox hired that midget .
Tom , you can' t say " midget . "
He' s small .
That guy was small for a friggin ' midget .
It' s like if the Red Sox thawed out Ted Williams , although he' d hit better than Stan .
Listen , Stan' s playing like he' s frozen .
Stan is embarrassing .
He' s embarrassing me .
He' s embarrassing him .
He should give it up .
But when an athlete gets to that point , he loses all his pride .
Yeah , you' re making me cry .
I don' t think he' s embarrassed .
I think he' s having a party at his place , got bitches all around and counting all his money .
I don' t think Stan cares .
Wrong !
He' s embarrassed .
He used to be able to hit , cannot hit now .
SALLE Y :
Very embarrassing , especially with all the bitches he got around .
Hey , Boca .
You think I should quit ?
Do your thing , man .
You think ?
I' m just saying .
Yeah , you' re right .
I got three home games against the Astros before we go on the road .
I' m gonna play those games , and that' s it .
If I don' t get a hit , it' s over .
I' m not goin ' on the road .
What you think , Boca ?
Do your thing , man .
You think ?
I' m just saying .
Yeah .
You' re right .
You want to get married ?
You the only one that love me .
I' m serious .
I' ve been waitin ' 20 years for you to ask me that .
And now that you have , I don' t know .
Yeah , you right .
Okay , Erica Kane .
Dog , come on .
" All My Children . "
You need to step up the degree of difficulty , brother .
Asa Buchanan .
- That' s ABC , right ?
- I ain' t telling you nothing .
- Oh !
" One Life to Live . "
- Yeah .
- Okay , I got one .
- Come on .
Don Roberto .
Don Roberto .
Oh , that' s the dude with the cologne .
" Guiding Light . "
- What ?
- Wrong !
It' s " Amigas y Rivales . "
No , we' re not doing Spanish shows , man .
I don' t know what you' re saying .
What the hell they doing ?
Seeing who can name the soaps .
You known me for two years .
- Have I ever spoke Spanish ?
- Hey .
Why don' t you have a contest guessin ' which team losin ' ?
- Stupid .
- Come on , Stan .
Get a hit , Grandpa .
Strike !
Charge !
Come on , Brewers !
- Oh !
- Strike three !
He tucks his arm in on the curve .
MAN ON P. A :
Number 21 , Stan Ross .
Out !
You see that ?
Hey , Skillett !
You see that ?
I was all over that nickel curve ball .
T- REX :
Looked like a groundout to me .
Say what , partner ?
I said , " It looked like a groundout to me . "
You don' t see it .
He tipped his pitch , and I called it .
Koron , how long has this pitcher been in the league ?
- Two years .
- Two years , man !
He' s showin ' his pitch , and he don' t know it .
Watch his right arm .
His elbow go in like this .
He grip the ball .
He throwin ' a curve ball .
Dip , grip , curve ball .
Come on , man !
Skillett !
Come on , baby !
Come on !
Runners lead away , and Fukuda working from the stretch .
The pitch , and a swing and a solid line- drive single to left field .
And another run scores .
The Astros in a position now to break this game wide- open .
Hey !
You okay ?
I don' t want Panas to take me out .
I had a few bad outings in a row , and if I don' t get my face out my ass and get out this inning ,
I know the team is going to give me the shoe .
Give you the shoe ?
Yeah , the shoe .
Look , don' t be thinkin ' negative out here , okay ?
Just keep the ball low and away .
We' il get you out the inning .
Then I' m gonna work on your cussin ' .
Come on .
Let' s go , baby .
Let' s go .
MAN ON P. A :
Shortstop , number 3 , Cecil Gervis .
Gervis , with a 6- game hitting streak , at the plate .
Fukuda checks his sign .
The right- hander from the stretch , checks the runners now , and here' s the pitch .
A big swing and a slow roller towards short .
Skillett charges .
His only play is to first .
He' s safe .
The bases are loaded .
- And Ross is hot .
- That' s the third out !
That' s the third damn out !
Ray Charles could' ve called that call !
Last warning .
Damn you , man !
Be with me .
Just be with me .
Come on , let' s go .
Let' s go !
Two out !
I don' t know why I bothered comin ' back .
You can' t play .
You definitely can' t ump .
You need to relax before you pop a valve .
- You need to sit your ass down .
- Yeah ?
Why' s that ?
- Because you out !
- He' s out !
Right here .
Right here , baby !
Grab some , bitch !
# #
# #
# #
# #
# #
Let' s go , Brewers , let' s go .
Their man keep throwing curve balls .
That' s all he got .
He lost his slider .
He lost his fastball .
Curve ball .
Curve ball .
Watch this .
Watch this .
Watch .
Here you go .
What' d I tell you ?
What' d I ...
- Curve ball .
- Listen to what I' m telling you .
If he throw another curve ball ,
I' m gonna slap the shit out of T- Rex .
Watch him .
Watch .
Watch .
Watch him .
Yes !
Curve ball !
# #
# #
# #
Aah , what' d I tell you ?
What' d I tell you , baby ?
Yo , what are you jawin ' about now , Old School ?
He tipped his pitch .
You saw it .
Are you still talking about that weak- ass ground ball ?
Yeah , I' m talking about it .
All right , let me tell you something , man .
All right ?
I hit 43 home runs .
43 home runs before you ever even got here , man .
So I don' t need none of that .
So save it !
- T- Rex .
- T- Rex .
It' s the 31st time you' ve homered but your team' s lost .
Does that get to you ?
My team lost , huh ?
You know what , man ?
This ain' t my team .
If this was my team , these fools would be hittin ' home runs like I' m hittin ' .
And they' d be stealin ' bases like I' m out there stealin ' .
I' m the only one out there gettin ' mine .
What the rest of these fools doin ' ?
They ain' t doin ' crap !
Talk about a team !
We go out there every day , but there ain' t no nine guys .
This is me up in here .
There' s eight other cats ...
Whoa !
Boy , that pup sound just like me back in the day , I swear .
Boy , I' m tellin ' you .
But you didn' t catch the real story on tonight' s game .
No , come here .
Let me ask you a question .
Move it over there .
When was the last time you saw a 47- year- old man end an inning with the hidden- ball trick , huh ?
Is that the first time you pulled that off in a game ?
Are the Brewers goin ' to the World Series ?
It was 1989 , against the Mariners .
Yo , T- Rex .
Hold up .
You know why I stepped in tonight with them reporters ?
Yeah .
You can' t stand to see another brother gettin ' some attention .
- Boy , that' s what you think ?
- Yeah , man , that' s what I think .
Let me tell you something .
You keep talking about your teammates the way you do , boastin ' about yourself , you' re gonna end up all by yourself .
All alone and empty , like you are right now .
You know what' s gonna happen ?
They' re gonna retire your number someday , and Big Horse Berelli gonna be standin ' up there with you .
Yeah ?
Who the hell is Big Horse Berelli ?
That' s my point exactly .
Nice car .
He' s picking up his stride , blowing away the competition .
Looks like the bratwurst is getting smoked .
No pun intended , kids .
Looks like number 3 , the Italian sausage , has won the race .
Now batting , first baseman , number 21 , Stan Ross .
Come on , man .
Charge !
Ha !
Yeah !
Whoo !
Hey , Stan !

Yo , listen up , y' all .
Yo !
Yo !
Listen up !
That was a good game , y' all .
Hey , Stan Ross .
I got one question for you , man .
Yo , man , what the hell was you thinkin ' ?
Y' all saw Old Man River swimmin ' all up in the dirt for a hit today !
Yo , but listen , man .
How many games we got left in this season ?
11 .
11 games left , y' all .
And how many games out of third place are we ?
7 .
7 games .
We' re only 7 games out , y' all .
Now , I don' t see a damn reason why we should settle for being in fifth place , yo !
- Yeah !
- Yeah !
So let' s get it together , and let' s do this like it' s October !
Yeah !
Yeah !
Yeah !
Yeah !
Hey !
Let' s get a " Brewers " on three !
Brewers on three !
- 1 , 2 , 3 !
- Brewers !
- 1 , 2 , 3 !
- Brewers !
- 1 , 2 , 3 !
- Brewers !
Ohh , but listen .
I' m on third base , right ?
Nolan Ryan looking at me like he want to kill me , right ?
Boca' s getting ready to bunt .
The manager didn' t call it .
But I know Boca' s a ballplayer .
He' s the real deal .
Plus , I know what he thinkin ' .
Yeah , he was thinkin ' that I was thinkin ' what he was thinkin ' .
Well , I' m ready to sprint towards home .
As I' m tearin ' down the line ,
Boca decided he wanted to swing away .
I wasn' t thinkin ' .
Man , wasn' t thinkin ' !
I mean , hit a screamin ' liner right past my head .
All I heard ...
Oh , hold on , fellas .
Hold on .
Uh- oh .
# #
So , you' re the story again .
Still mad at me ?
Hmm ?
Nah .
I' m hittin ' now .
# #
# #
- # # - Mmmm .
# #
# #
# #
See , this is the part I' m talkin ' about .
# #
# #
# #
- # # - Yeah . - # # - Well ...
Hey , where you goin ' ?
I gotta go .
You gotta go where ?
I just gotta go .
What' s up ?
Look , Stan , it was just sex , right ?
I mean , best sex I ever had , too , but that' s all it was .
Whoa , whoa , whoa .
What about the sleepin ' , talkin ' , and hangin ' out part ?
- What about that ?
- That' s your idea of sex .
Hold on .
A man could be wrong .
You said it wasn' t sex .
I' m just trying to go with that .
It was really nice , Stan .
Wait .
Let me talk to you for a minute .
- Oh , oh , hold on now .
- What ?
Wait , look .
Look .
What ?
I was thinkin ' about that producer .
The behind- the- camera stuff you was talkin ' about .
And I' m just wonderin ' .
Ain' t that something you can do here in Milwaukee ?
Stan .
Stan .
Stan , you' re being very sweet .
But we both know that you ain' t never been serious enough to go bringin ' up something like that .
So I' il see you at the ball park .
Slugger .

# #
# #
- Hey , Stan .
- Yo .
- Say , " 1 , 2 , 3 , go . "
- 1 , 2 , 3 , go .
# #
# #
# #
Yo , yo !
Come on , with that noise .
I' m tryin ' to watch a game .
What are you talkin ' about ,
This song is baseball .
That ain' t no real baseball song .
You want to hear a real baseball song ?
# #
# #
# #
# #
# #
# #
# #
# #
- # # - What the hell is that ?
What ?
Man , let me tell you something .
When I was a kid on South Side Chicago , we used to play baseball when we got out of school till it got dark , when you couldn' t see your hand in front of your face .
I used to play center field , and every single day , man , Mister Softee ice- cream truck used to park right behind me and play that damn song .
- Told you ! - # #
Yo !
Hey , yo !
Yo !
Yo !
Yo !
Fellas , come on , now .
We got a game goin ' on out here .
Come on , we got a shot at third place .
You' re right .
Besides , dog , that was wack !
Fairmount Park , Philly , son .
We had that Good Humor truck .
And this is what baseball music sounds like .
# #
# #
# #
- Boo !
- Boo !
# #
# #
# #
That' s why you' re not playin ' today , ' cause of that song .
You' re wrong for that .
Don' t make no errors .
It was wrong the way I quit on the team back then .
I was young , Skip .
I was young .
MAN ON P. A :
Now batting , shortstop , number 46 ,
Thurman Yost .
Mow him down , Fu !

Beyatch .
That' s pimp stuff .
Kiss my ...
- Black ass !
- No , don' t get personal .
Don' t get personal .
No , no , no .
- I didn' t mean it .
- I know .
Stan' s batting average in 1985 .
Come on , come on , come on , come on .
- . 327 .
- Yeah .
Yeah , okay .
Okay , my turn .
Stan Ross ' RBls in 1981 .
- 91 .
- Oh , no , 93 !
Bullcrap !
Let me see that .
Yeah , right .
- Crap !
- 93 .
- Let' s play again .
- I don' t want to play .
- You don' t want to play ?
- We got a game .
Get serious .
You' re a sore loser .
You know what ?
Crybaby !
He' s such a crybaby .
- Strike !
- Oh !
Uhh !
Game tied at 4 .
Just one out and the winning run at third base .
The Astro infield moving in .
And here comes Stan Ross .
He could win the game here with a long fly ball , but you can bet that' s not what he' s thinking .
Infield tight , hitter' s delight .
A great chance to get hit number 2, 999 .
T- REX :
Come on , y' all .
Here we go , Stan .
Be a hitter , baby .
Be a hitter .
Come on , just drive the man in .
A good fly ball , okay ?
And here comes the pitch .
He swings , and it' s a high fly ball to right .
It' s carrying well .
It' s to the warning track .
To the wall !
It is gone !
A home run !
Whoo !
Stan Ross touches them all .
I don' t believe it .
Aah !
# # - # # - Aaaah !
# #
# #
Huh ?
Who' s the old man , baby ?
- Who' s the old man , baby ?
- 21 !
Who' s the old man , baby ?
Huh ?
I got your " old man , " baby .
I got your " old man . "
I got your " old man . "
Way to go , Stan .
I gave ' em they money worth tonight .
Outstanding .
You feel good ?
- I feel great .
- You look great .
You looked like a champion out there .
- Let me paint you a picture .
- Go ahead .
Miller Park , standing room only .
- Got that ?
- I got it .
43, 000 screaming fans , and they' re there for one reason and one reason only .
To watch the legendary Stan Ross step to the plate and dig in .
Shoot , that ain' t no picture .
That' s a damn Rembrandt .
I agree , and that' s why I' m telling Gus not to play you on the road .
Hold on , man .
Chill out , baby .
What are you talking about ?
Man , we' re on a roll .
We' re going for third place .
You' re one hit away from making history , Stan .
Don' t you think you owe it to the fans to do it here at home ?
Hmm ?
I don' t know .
You' re takin ' half my at- bats away .
Although I hit a home run , I' m still 2 for 51 .
2 for 58 !
# #
Look , what I' m sayin ' is , don' t cut me out .
The team need me .
Come on , now .
Stan , you heard the sausage .
You' re 2 for 58 .
The team doesn' t need you to get third place .
They' re on fire !
Come on , let' s face it .
But you , my friend , you have got to start thinking about life after baseball .
I' m talking endorsements , product lines .
A Stan Ross candy bar .
I want you doing press all week long on the road , Stan .
You pull this off , nothing' s gonna keep you out of the Hall of Fame .
You' re a champion .
Hey , Stan , Tom Arnold here .
Congratulations on everything .
The team' s on a tear .
You won seven in a row .
You guys could finish third .
Are you really talking to us from the clubhouse ?
Well , they' re not gonna play me until I come home , so I might as well do something else with my time .
Stan , how does it feel not to be playing right now ?
It don' t feel good , especially the way I' ve been swinging , but that' s Skip' s decision .
I have to go with it because , as you say , we got a chance to make third place .
And they were in fifth place when you got there .
I finally got them playin ' patented Stan Ross baseball .
Okay , Stan .
Stan Ross , at 47 , the oldest man to homer in the major leagues .
How' s it feel ?
To tell you the truth , we never thought you could do it , and some of us hoped you wouldn' t , so we owe you an apology big- time .
Well , it takes a big man to admit when he wrong , but like my teammate Kenji Fukuda taught me to say ...
What the hell is he talking about ?
- Stan .
- What does the future hold ?
- Yeah , Stan .
- What about number 3, 000 ?
What game are you gonna get this hit in ?
I think I' m gonna get it on the next at- bat .
You got another homer left in you ?
Keep your popcorn by your side ' cause it' s comin ' .
- Stan Ross .
- Is it gonna be a home run ?
The faster you throw it in , the quicker it' s goin ' out .
Hey , Stan .
I hope you weren' t listening to the trash we were talking about you before you hit your groove .
Tom , you wouldn' t be where you are if it wasn' t for Roseanne .
You know what ?
That would have hurt if it wasn' t true .
Stan Ross .
Stan Ross .
Stan Ross .
Hey , girl , you been watchin ' ?
The whole world loves me again , baby .
Stan Ross , the King of Swing .
Sweetheart , I' m goin ' national .
You know , you' re starting to sound like the old Stan .
No , you' re gettin ' the best of both worlds .
The old and the new Stan Ross .
Team player , baby .
So after you go national with all this press , what' s left for me ?
I' m gonna tell you what' s left for you .
I' m gonna give you a special exclusive .
You meet me at the ball park Thursday morning at 9 : 00 .
Just you , me , and the team .
I called a practice on my day off on our last home stand .
Wait a minute .
Stan Ross called for an extra practice ?
Now , I never thought I' d live to see this day .
I guess you are getting a little serious , huh ?
Maybe I' m gettin ' serious about you .
I' il see you at practice .
Baby , you owe it to yourself .
Bye .
Oh , boy .
What you gonna do ?
Whoo !
- Hey , hey !
- How you doin ' , dog ?
Hey , Stan , go get your hit this Saturday , man .
I got tickets for that one .
No , I got tickets for tomorrow !
You save the stubs , boys and girls , because I' m going deep every game , and they all gonna be collector' s items .
You- all watch and see .
Come here .
I got a new idea .
Listen .
I got a new PlayStation game , " Hall of Fame Baseball , " where I get a chance to hit against those pitchers that were dead before I was born ,
like Walter Johnson and Christy Mathewson , and that candy- ass Cy Young .
Well , you draw up the plans .
You got a call an hour ago from " The Tonight Show . "
They want you on there tomorrow .
I' m on a roll , man .
I' m tellin ' you .
- That' s big- time exposure .
- Here' s the hook .
They want you at the studio at 9 : 00 .
That' s cool .
But you got that extra practice .
That' s one practice .
One practice .
I' m talking about Jay Leno .
That' s bigger than the game .
Stan Ross , come on out here !
What' s up ?
What' s up , baby ?
All on , baby .
Have a seat .
All right .
Team Brewer is on a roll , making a push for third place .
Ha ha , baby , I' m on a roll , too , Jay .
I' m on a roll , too .
I' m sure to stay on that roll , what , are you taking the Ensure every day ?
Is it once a day ?
And then you have a sensible meal for dinner .
I can do anything a 20- year- old can do .
Any doggone thing , baby .
- Anything , huh ?
- Show you right .
Show you right .
And I can do it all night .
Dave ?
Yeah , there' s a large black man hitting on your wife .
- Yeah , show you right .
- What' s next ?
I started my own little stuff right here .
Check this out .
Look at that .
- My own little candy .
- " Ross Bar . "
Get a shot of that one .
That is the most ratty- ass candy bar I' ve ever seen .
It' s a piece of loose- leaf paper you wrote " Ross Bar " on .
- It' s a prototype .
- Oh , the prototype .
You gotta start somewhere .
You know , I' m an entrepreneur .
Once you get over the initial modesty , I think you' il be fine .
You talkin ' to the ladies ' pet the men regret .
I' m Stan Ross .
What' s my name , baby ?
Stan Ross !
- They call me what ?
- The boss !
- Because I ...
- Pay the cost !
- Because I' m ...
- Stan Ross !
Turn it up , baby !
Stan Ross .
Be right back right after this .
Don' t go away .
Yes , sir .
Boca !
Yo , Bo !
Did you see me , baby ?
Ha ha .
Jay and I did our thing .
That ain' t no ESPN .
I' m talkin ' big- time .
Hey .
Hey , baby .
Don' t you " baby " me .
I went to the park this morning , and you weren' t there .
Your entire team was there , and you' re a no- show .
Well , I mean ...
" Well ? " Didn' t you call for the practice ?
Besides letting down your teammates , you told me I could interview you .
Well , interview me now .
Come on , turn the camera on .
It' s not like I' m hiding from you .
I' il come right around .
That ain' t nothin ' .
Shoot .
Come on , baby .
All right , forget this .
I' il freestyle it .
- Mark , Steve , are you ready ?
- You didn' t ask if I' m ready .
- You always ready .
- Let me get on that side .
You can see the balls .
It looks better .
- Hey , how you doin ' ?
- All right .
Good .
Come on , baby .
I' m here with Hall of Famer hopeful Stan Ross , who is now just one hit from reclaiming his cherished 3, 000 career hits .
But let' s talk about the name " Mr. 3000 . "
Fit just right , doesn' t it ?
Why is there so much emphasis on the name ?
Why do you care so much about it ?
Because it identifies greatness .
When you think of Mr. 3000 , you think of Mr. Stan Ross , one of the greatest hitters straight up and down .
Who were you before Mr. 3000 ?
Mr. 3000 .
I' m just kidding .
Before that , I was a young black kid on the South Side of Chicago , Stanley Ross , playin ' baseball .
What does Stanley Ross think of Mr. 3000 ?
He wants his autograph .
- Really ?
- Really .
- What about your teammates ?
- They don' t need it .
They get the chance to see history in the making .
Oh , okay .
So what you' re saying is , your teammates get to see your 3, 000th hit , but not potentially move into third place ?
What I' m saying is , thousands of people bought tickets this weekend , not to see us play for third place , but to see me get my hit .
- Really ?
- Damn right .
It' s the same reason why everybody else here .
Same reason why you here , unless you' re here for something else .
Oh , okay .
You selfish son of a bitch !
- You don' t want that on- camera .
- No , I' m fine .
Because I' m not the one who' s desperate to live his entire life in front of the camera .
Tell them about Toronto and the history you left there .
- That' s so old .
- Your damn ego is so old !
It hasn' t changed , Stan .
I mean , how am I supposed to think about moving here when you can' t do what you say you' re gonna do ?
Mo , it' s only one damn practice , baby .
You know it' s bigger than one practice , Stan .
But you' re right .
I am here to record your history in the making .
And it' s the same as it ever was .
Mo .
You gonna run after her ?
No .
I' il catch her later .
I got ball games to play .
What ?
- Whew .
- What ?
No , I' m just saying , man , that' s why I love you , man .
Wait a minute .
What do you mean ?
I' m just saying that I could always count on you to do your thing , you know ?
You' re consistent .
You' re always driven .
And you' re always for yourself .
You sayin ' that' s a good thing ?
I' m just saying .

Just two weeks ago , fans , the Milwaukee Brewers seemed willing to accept their perennial position in the division cellar .
Is it more than a coincidence that their solid defense and clutch hitting started with Stan Ross ' 2, 998th hit ?
While Ross was just a spectator during their last road trip ,
T- Rex Pennebaker has emerged as the team leader .
We' ve all witnessed the mounting frustration for Ross , who has gone hitless in the first two games against the Astros in this , his final home stand .
You can' t help but wonder what' s going through his mind as Ross ' window of opportunity to join that elite 3, 000- hit club is about to close and close before a nationwide audience .
So , here we are .
The stage is set .
A re- energized team plays for respectability , while Stan Ross knocks on the door of baseball greatness .
Tonight , 35, 000 fans witness as history unfolds over nine innings of Brewers baseball .
Last chance to go out there and get yours .
We have a lineup change tonight .
In hopes of squeezing out an extra at- bat for Ross , he' s hitting cleanup right behind Rex Pennebaker .
MAN ON P. A :
Now batting , first baseman , number 21 ,
Stan Ross !
This big crowd is charged tonight .
The right- hander Norton , one of the most competitive pitchers in the league , will do everything he can to avoid being a footnote in baseball history .
One game , one more hit , and he has that magical 3, 000 .
Ball .
They' re on their feet , rooting for Ross to get ahold of one , as Norton gets his sign .
Ross puts a good swing on it .
It' s deep to right field and carrying well .
Damn .
Yo , Ross !
Why don' t you take a seat ?
You ain' t gettin ' that hit off me tonight !
Deal with it !
- This guy' s slider sucks .
- Come on , man .
I guess somebody should have showed up to that practice .
Home half of the fourth .
It' s still a scoreless tie .
This crowd ripe with anticipation every time Ross steps to the plate .
Ross swings .
A sharp ground ball up the middle .
Second baseman Gomez with a diving stop .
He scrambles .
It' s gonna be close .
He' s out !
Oh , my , what a close play !
From our angle , I thought he was safe .
You' re wrong !
I' m surprised Stan Ross isn' t protesting the call .
- That man was safe !
- That man was out .
What game are you watching ?
I called the man out .
I' m watching the same game you are !
- We are playing for third place !
- The man was out !
Don' t make me run you , Gus .
You got your head so far up your ass , you didn' t see the play !
- Head up my ass ?
- That' s right !
Head up your ass !
- That' s what I said !
- That' s it !
You' re outta here !
You' re outta here !
Let me tell you something !
Get off of my field !
You' re the worst umpire in this whole league !
Outta here !
You' re such a jerk !
The man was safe !
The guy' s out !
He was safe !
Walk him off the field !
- Get him off my field !
- You were safe !
You were safe !
You were beautiful .
Come on , tiger .
He was safe !
So it boils down to the bottom of the ninth inning .
Still scoreless here in the final game of the season .
" Mr. 2999 " very likely will be making his last plate appearance of a storied big- league career .
But first the man who' s become sort of Ross ' protege of late ,
T- Rex Pennebaker .
We' ve got an interesting situation here , fans .
If Pennebaker homers , that' s the game , and Ross won' t get another shot .
Go , T !
Come on , baby !
Come on , baby .
Get on .
I' il bring you home .
Come on , get on , baby .
Just get on .
And that ball is crushed .
A line drive to deep left center .
It' s going , going .
It is off the base of the wall .
Pennebaker rounds first , heading for second .
And he is safe with a ringing double .
Oh , man !
He almost took the bat right out of Stan Ross ' hands .
But now Ross is up with not only a chance for his 3, 000th base hit and a call from Cooperstown , but an opportunity to drive in the winning run and end the Brewers ' season on a high note .
3, 000 , baby !
All right .
Come on .
Ball .
- Pitch to him .
- Let' s go , man .
Get your hit .
- Ball .
- Pitch to me , damn it !
Reach out there and get it , then .
Reach out and get it .
Those first two deliveries , way outside .
Ross now crowding the plate .
2 balls , no strikes .
Nothing close from Norton .
I' m right here !
Here we go .
This is it .
3- 0 , the count .
This crowd roaring , begging Norton to challenge Ross with a decent pitch .
I could always count on you to do your thing , you know ?
You' re consistent .
You' re always driven .
And you' re always for yourself .
That' s why I love you .
Look at this !
Ross lays a sacrifice bunt up the first- base line , and T- Rex isn' t stopping at third .
Here' s a throw to first base , and Ross is out .
Here comes the play .
The slide , the tag .
He is safe !
He is safe !
The Brewers win !
The Brewers win !
