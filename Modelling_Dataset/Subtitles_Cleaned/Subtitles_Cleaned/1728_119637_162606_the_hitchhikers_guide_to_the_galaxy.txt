It' s an important and popular fact that things are not always what they seem .
For instance , on the planet Earth , man had always assumed that he was the most intelligent species occupying the planet , instead of the third most intelligent .
The second most intelligent creatures were dolphins , who , curiously enough , had long known of the impending destruction of the planet Earth .
They' d made many attempts to alert mankind , but most of their communications were misinterpreted as amusing attempts to punch footballs or whistle for tidbits .
So they eventually decided they would leave Earth by their own means .
The last ever dolphin message was misinterpreted as a sophisticated attempt to do a backward somersault through a hoop , whistling The Star- Spangled Banner .
In fact , the message was this :
- [ bell rings ]
- " So long and thanks for all the fish . "
[ Up tempo drum intro to big band number ]
[ male chorus ]
( So long and thanks for all the fish ) ( So sad that it should come to this ) ( We tried to warn you all but , oh , dear ) ( You may not share our intellect ) ( Which might explain your disrespect ) ( For all the natural wonders that grow around you ) ( So long , so long and thanks ... for all the fish )
[ female chorus ]
( Your world' s about to be destroyed ) ( There' s no point getting all annoyed ) ( Lie back and let the planet dissolve around you ) [ male chorus ]
( Despite those nets of tuna fleets ) ( We thought that most of you were sweet ) ( Especially tiny tots and your pregnant women ) ( So long , so long , so long , so long , so long ) [ female chorus ]
( So long , so long ) [ whole chorus ]
( So long , so long and thanks for all the fish )
[ girl solo ]
( If I had just one last wish ) ( I would like a tasty fish ) [ woman solo ]
( If we could just change one thing ) ( We would all have learnt to sing ) [ full chorus ]
( Come one and all ) ( Man and mammal ) ( Side by side ) ( In life' s great gene pool ! )
[ male chorus ]
( So long , so long , so long ) [ female chorus ]
( So long , so long ) [ whole chorus ]
( So long , so long and thanks for all the fish ! )

[ male narrator ]
The extraordinary story of The Hitchhiker' s Guide to the Galaxy begins very simply .
It begins with a man .
Ooh !
An Earthman , to be precise .
Who no more knows his destiny , than a tea leaf knows the history of the East India Company .
[ buzz ]
His name is Arthur Dent .
He is a five- foot- eight- inch- tall ape descendant and someone is trying to drive a bypass through his house .
What do I want you to do about it ?
Find him and tell him I' m currently lying flat on my back in front of ...
Fine , I' il hold .
You can' t lie in front of the bulldozers for ever .
I' m game .
We' il see who rusts first .
This bypass has got to be built and it is going to be built .
- Why has it got to be built ?
- It' s a bypass .
You' ve got to build bypasses .
Besides , you should' ve protested months ago .
The plans have been on display at the planning office for a year .
On display ?
I had to go down to a cellar .
Mr Dent , have you any idea how much damage this bulldozer would suffer if I just let it roll straight over you ?
- How much ?
- None at all .
[ narrator ]
By a strange coincidence , none at all is exactly how much suspicion ape- descendant Arthur had that one of his closest friends was not descended from an ape , but was , in fact , from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse .
Arthur !
Arthur !
- [ Arthur ]
Ford !
- Yes ?
Here .
Ah , there you are !
[ Ford ]
Eat , drink .
We gotta talk .
Now' s not the best time .
They' re going to demolish my home .
Whoa !
You already ...
You already know ?
How ?
What do you m ... ?
Oh , they , they ?
When you say " they " you mean they ?
Got it .
Listen .
I got somethin ' important I gotta tell you .
Right now .
Well , what about my house ?
[ Ford ]
Workers of the Earth , I bring good tidings of peanuts and beer !
[ workers ' excited chatter ]
- Good .
Let' s go to the pub .
- Huh ?
They won' t demolish it until they' ve finished the beers .
- Can we trust ' em ?
- To the end of the Earth .
- How far' s that ?
- About 1 2 minutes away .
Huh ?
Barman , six pints of bitter and quickly .
The world' s about to end .
Barman , six pints of bitter and quickly .
The world' s about to end .
Six pints coming up .
[ Ford ]
Keep the change .
You got about ten minutes to spend it .
Three pints each ?
At lunchtime ?
[ loud gulping ]
Sorry .
Ah .
Time is an illusion .
Lunchtime , doubly so .
And eat those peanuts , because you' il need the salt .
- Look , what is going on , Ford ?
- Arthur ...
What if I told you I really wasn' t from Guildford ?
I was from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse ?
Is that something you' re likely to say ?
Remember when we met ?
- [ Ford mimics car ]
- [ car horn ]
[ Arthur ]
Out the way !
- [ Arthur ]
Oof !
- Hi .
Wasn' t it strange I was trying to shake hands with a car ?
I assumed you were drunk .
I thought cars were the dominant life form .
I was introducing myself .
You saved my life .
And now I' m saving yours .
Please drink .
It must be Thursday .
I could never get the hang of Thursdays .
- If this is about your house ...
- No , it' s not about the house .
- [ Arthur tuts ]
- [ phone beeps ]
- [ Ford ]
Who' s he ?
- [ Arthur ]
She .
She .
Tricia McMillan .
We met at a fancy- dress party .
[ Arthur ]
I hate those kind of parties .
I' d rather have stayed at home and ironed my hankies .
- But there I was .
- [ Tricia ]
Who are you ?
- [ Arthur ]
Oh !
- And there she was .
- Uh , Dent .
Arthur Dent .
- Oh , no .
I mean , who are you ?
Oh , the costume ?
Right .
" Livingstone , I presume ! "
Yeah , it' s not as clever as Darwin , but the best I could do at short notice .
You' re the first to get that right .
- [ Arthur ]
Really ?
- Yes .
Everyone calls me Santa .
- Right .
- I thought the beagle was a giveaway .
So did l .
People at these parties are drunken idiots .
- What ?
- [ music stops ]
[ Arthur ]
All these people are idiots !
God !
[ Tricia laughs ]
That' s awkward .
[ Arthur ]
Tell me .
She was amazing though , Ford .
Beautiful , witty , mad as a balloon .
[ Arthur ]
Uh , without the beard , you look at least 80 years younger .
Maybe I' m de- evolving .
[ both laugh ]
[ Arthur ]
Well , I should tell you that I do not date single- celled organisms , okay ?
Let' s go somewhere .
Yeah .
Definitely .
Um , where do you have in mind ?
- Madagascar .
- Is that that new club on Dean Street ?
No , it' s a country off the coast of Africa .
That Madagascar ?
Why are we waiting here ?
- Wait a sec .
- [ Tricia laughs ]
Go .
God , you' re serious .
Um , I can' t go to Madagascar .
- Why not ?
- [ Arthur ]
Because , I just , you know ...
- You' re serious ?
- Yeah .
I want to go somewhere I' ve never been and I' d like to go with you , so ... ... what do you say , Dr Livingstone ?
I say that' s an extraordinary proposition .
I can' t go .
I mean , I' ve got a job .
Quit .
Get a new one when you come back .
I don' t even know your real name .
Ow !
Ow !
- Tricia McMillan .
- Well , Tricia McMillan .
Um , I have a proposition for you .
Why don' t we go somewhere a little closer first , say Cornwall , and we' il see how it goes .
Right , of course , Cornwall .
[ man ]
Hey , excuse me .
[ squeak ]
Is this guy boring you ?
Why don' t you talk to me instead ?
I' m from a different planet .
It' s true .
You want to see my spaceship ?
[ Tricia laughs ]
" Do you want to see my spaceship ? "
What kind of chat- up line is that ?
Mm , that does happen .
- Speaking of ...
- [ electronic bleeps ]
We' ve got two minutes .
Drink up .
- [ rumbling ]
- That' s my house .
People of Earth , a round of drinks , for everyone , on me .
[ barman ]
You really think the world' s going to end ?
Yes .
Shouldn' t we lie down , or put a paper bag over our heads , or something ?
- If you like .
- Will it help ?
Not at all .
See you .
[ barman ]
Last orders !
[ workmen shouting ]
[ pants ]
[ engines whir ]
- [ workman ]

Run !

Look out !
[ shouts and screams ]
[ rumbling ]

Aha !

Arthur !
What the hell are those things ?
[ Ford ]
Yeow !
They' re ships from a Vogon constructor fleet .
I picked up their signal this morning .
You' il need this .
[ whimpers ]
- [ Arthur ]
What are you doing ?
- We' re hitching a ride .
[ feedback ]
Um , people of Earth , this is Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz of the Galactic Hyperspace Planning Council .
As you are probably aware , plans for the development of the outlying regions of the galaxy involve the building of a hyperspace express route through your star system .
And your planet is one of those scheduled for demolition .
[ screaming ]

[ sheep bleat ]
There' s no point acting surprised about it .
The plans have been on display at your local planning office in Alpha Centauri for 50 Earth years .

[ narrator/ Guide ]
The Hitchhiker' s Guide to the Galaxy is a wholly remarkable book .
Perhaps the most remarkable , certainly the most successful , ever to come out of the great publishing corporations of Ursa Minor .
More popular than The Celestial Homecare Omnibus , better selling than 53 More Things to Do in Zero Gravity , and more controversial than Oolon Colluphid' s trilogy of philosophical blockbusters , Where God Went Wrong ,
Some More of God' s Greatest Mistakes , and Who Is This God Person Anyway ?
It' s already supplanted the Encyclopedia Galactica as the standard repository of all knowledge and wisdom for two important reasons .
First , it' s slightly cheaper , and second , it has the words " Don ' t Panic " printed in large , friendly letters on its cover .
So you ' re not from Guildford ?
Which would explain the accent , which I' ve always wondered about .
Um , you' re not an out- of- work actor , but rather a writer for this , this book thing .
- [ electronic buzzing ]
- [ Ford ]
Good , huh ?
I don' t feel well .
I need a cup of tea .
If I asked where we were , would I regret it ?
- [ Ford ]
We' re safe for now .
- [ Arthur ]
Good .
We' re in the washroom on one of the ships of the Vogon constructor fleet .
- Oh , get me home , Ford .
- Arthur , your home is ...
Oh , God , my home .
My home was demolished .
[ hollow clang ]
You don' t remember .
Okay , Arthur , I' ve got something to tell you .
It' s unfortunate , but it' s true .
Your home planet has been blown up .
- Huh , blown up .
- [ Ford grunts ]
[ grunts ]
Couldn' t you have done something ?
I saved your life .
Okay , that makes us even .
It' s a tough galaxy .
If you want to survive out here , you' ve ... ... gotta know where your towel is .
Okay , give me a hand over here .
Careful .
It' s hot .
We' ve gotta get off this ship .
Before the Vogons find us .
Vogons , they hate hitchhikers .
Pull .
- [ Arthur ]
Huh ?
- [ steam hisses ]
[ Ford laughs ]
- Now we' il get a signal .
- What is a Vogon ?
Ask the Guide .
Say " Vogons " .
- [ electronic chimes ]
- Vogons .
[ Guide ]
Vogons are one of the most unpleasant races in the galaxy .
Not evil , but bad- tempered , bureaucratic , officious and callous .
They wouldn' t even lift a finger to save their own grandmothers from the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal without orders signed in triplicate , sent in , sent back , queried , lost , found , subjected to public inquiry ,
Iost again and finally buried in soft peat for three months and recycled as firelighters .
On no account should you allow a Vogon to read poetry to you .
[ klaxon ]
[ Ford ]
They can' t think or imagine .
Most can' t spell .
They just run things .
Hmm ?
[ grunts ]
And if we don' t get a ride soon , we won' t need the Guide to tell us how unpleasant the Vogons are .
They' ve already destroyed a planet today .
That always makes them a little eee !
[ loudspeaker : unintelligible shouting ]
Ughh !
What is that ?
- Put this in your ear .
- Huh ?
[ Arthur gibbers ]
[ Vogon ]
We have unwittingly picked up a couple of hitchhikers .
The fish is translating for you .
[ Guide ]
The Babel fish is small , yellow , leech- like , and probably the oddest thing in the universe .
It feeds on brainwave energy , absorbing unconscious frequencies , and excreting a matrix of conscious frequencies to the speech centers of the brain .
The practical upshot of which is that , if you stick one in your ear , you instantly understand anything said to you in any language .
[ rumbling , crashing ]
Resistance is useless .
- [ Arthur ]
All right .
- [ Vogon ]
Someone' s coming .
[ Vogon # 2 ]
Here we go .
Look lively .
[ rumble and crash of doors ]
[ Vogon grunts ]
[ Vogons chatter ]

Wheee !

Ha , ha !

Hmmm .

Sir .

What ?

Hitchhikers .

" O freddled gruntbuggly ... "
No , really , you don' t have to read .
We' ve put you through enough trouble already . " ... as plerdled gabbleblotchits on a lurgid bee . "
[ Guide ]
Vogon poetry is widely accepted as the third worst in the universe .
[ groans ]
[ Guide ]
The second worst is that of the Azgoths of Kria .
During a recitation by their Poet Master , Grunthos the Flatulent , of his poem Ode to a Small Lump of Green Putty
I Found in my Armpit One Midsummer Morning , four of his audience died of internal hemorrhaging , and the President of the Mid- Galactic Arts Nobbling Council survived by gnawing one of his own legs off .
" Or I will rend thee in the gobberwarts ... "
- [ Ford screams weakly ]
- " ... with my blurgle ... "
[ Guide ]
The absolute worst poetry was by Paula Millstone Jennings of Sussex .
Luckily , it was destroyed when the Earth was .
" See if I don' t . " Yeah .
[ Vogons chortle ]
So , Earthlings , I present you with a choice .
Either die in the vacuum of space , or tell me what you thought of my poem .
[ Vogons chuckle ]
A ... a ... actually , I rather liked it .
- [ Jeltz ]
Hmm ?
- [ Ford ]
Yeah .
- That' s good .
Run with it .
- Hmmm .
Uh , some of the words I didn' t understand , but I found the imagery quite effective .
Continue .
Well , uh , yes , interesting rhythmic devices , which seemed to counterpoint the underlying metaphor of the humanity of ...
- Vogonity !
- Vogonity , sorry , vogonity ... of the poet' s soul .
[ Vogons murmur ]
So what you' re saying is ,
I write poetry because underneath this mean , callous , heartless exterior ,
I just want to be loved ?
[ whispers ]
Yes , yes , yes .
Yes , yes , yeah , please .
Ahh , ooh , ooh , mmm .
Throw them off the ship !
- [ Ford ]
No !
No !
- Ford .
Ford !
Ahh !
All right !
All right !
[ Vogon guard ]
Resistance is useless !
Shut up !
Get a job !
Wash your filthy hands !
Don' t panic .
Don' t panic .
[ Arthur ]
So this is it ?
We' re going to die ?
Yeah , we' re gonna die .
No , no , what' s this ?
What is this ?
What' s this ?
This is ... nothing .
Yeah , we' re gonna die .
[ Arthur sighs ]

" Space , " says the introduction to The Hitchhiker' s Guide ,
" is big .
Really big . "
" You just won' t believe how vastly , hugely , mind- bogglingly big it is . "
A ... a ... and so on .
It also says that if you hold a lungful of air , you can survive in the total vacuum of space for about 30 seconds .
But with space being really big and all , the chances of being picked up within that time are two to the power of two billion , 79 million , 460 thousand , 347 to one against .
By a staggering coincidence , it' s also the phone number of the Islington flat , where Arthur went to a fancy dress party and met a very nice young woman whom he totally blew it with .
[ boom ]
Though the planet Earth , the Islington flat and telephone have all now been demolished , Ford and Arthur were , in fact , rescued .
- [ Arthur ]
Ford ?
- [ Ford ]
Y es .
- [ Arthur ]
I think I' m a sofa .
- [ Ford ]
I know how you feel .
[ both scream ]
So much for the laws of physics .
[ TV woman ]
And our top story .
The sensational theft of the most coveted ship in the universe , the starship Heart of Gold .
Stolen at the launch ceremony by none other than Galactic President Zaphod Beeblebrox .
[ Zaphod ]
In the name of people , freedom , and , uh ... democracy , stuff like that ,
I hereby kidnap myself and I' m taking the ship with me .
Whoo !
- Come on !
- [ crowd gasps ]
[ TV ]
Beeblebrox , universally considered to be the dimmest star in several solar systems , is most famous for his controversial defeat of Humma Kavula who claimed many thought they were voting for the worst- dressed being in the universe contest .
Great .
Kavula is best remembered for his slanderous
" Don ' t Vote for Stupid ! " campaign .
[ woman ]
Put your ego aside .
Something important has happened .
If there' s anything more important than my ego , I want it caught and shot now .
Come on , I love it .
[ TV ]
Zaphod' s just this guy , you know .
Hey , hey , hey , hey .
What d' you ... ?
- I was just watching myself .
- We have a couple of hitchhikers .
Hitchhikers ?
Why' d you pick up hitchhikers ?
I didn' t .
The ship did .
[ Zaphod ]
What ?
Wh ... wh ...
Say what ?
When we engaged the lmprobability Drive ...
The big button .
- [ Zaphod ]
I know .
- They were picked up here .
In sector ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha .
Wait .
That' s where you picked me up .
- On Earth .
- That' s impossible .
- No , just very improbable .
- Listen .
I don' t have time for this .
We' ve got the police of half the galaxy after us .
We' ve stopped for hitchhikers .
So ten out of ten for style , but ... ... minus several million for good thinking .
You' re too gorgeous , baby , stop it .
You drive me crazy .
Don' t .
I' il send Marvin .
- Marvin .

[ Marvin ]
You ought to know , I' m feeling very depressed .
Well , we have something that should take your mind off things .
[ Marvin ]
It won' t work .
I have an exceptionally large mind .
Yeah , we know .
But we need you to go down to the number two entry bay and pick up our stowaways and bring them up here .
[ Marvin ]
Just that ?
I won' t enjoy it .
Yeah , well , that' s life .

Anyway , come on .

- How you doin ' ?
- Hey , Trillian .
This is my semi- half- brother lx , I' m sorry , Ford .
- Hi .
- Hi .
Um , would you excuse us for a second , please ?
You went down on that little planet and didn' t call me ?
Sorry , I didn' t know .
I had a galaxy to run .
[ Arthur ]
Hi , Tricia McMillan , right ?
I think he called you Trillian .
Which of us got the right one ?
I shortened it .
Something a little more spacey .
Right .
I was thinking of changing mine to ,
I don' t know , Arthoolia .
[ laughs ]
That' s a good one .
Well , this is weird .
- How' d you get here ?
- I just stuck out my thumb .
- Right .
In your pajamas ?
- I was in a hurry .
Okay .
Did you know I was here ?
Don' t flatter yourself .
I' ve got a spaceman too .
Yeah , that' s kinda like the Dingo Shuffle , yeah .
Okay , um , look .
I left you at the party .
I feel bad , but I was gonna call you when I got back .
Well , there is no going back now , is there ?
You do know what happened ?
Enough small talk .
We' re on the run , remember ?
Excuse me , we' re having a chat .
Well , I think the girl' s getting ...
Boo !
You blew it with her , Earthman , so shut your face or I' il kick you in the zatch .
- You wanna fight ?
- Okay .
- No .
No .
- I' m just kidding .
I' m a kidder .
Let' s be friends .
Let' s connect .
You and l .
Didn' t see that one coming , did you ?
Popped right out of the box .
You foxy , yeah !
Teach your pal a lesson , Ford .
He' s a guest on my ship .
[ sings ]
He' s a guest on my ship !
I thought you said you stole it .
[ thud ]
Stole what ?
What are we talking about ?
- [ electronic klaxon ]
- Whoa !
That doesn' t sound good .
[ whoosh ]
- Are you okay ?
- Just fabulous , thanks , " Trill " .
A little help over here .
I' m in over my head .
I' il take care of this .
Good Zarquon , do I have to do everyhing ?
[ laughing ]
Yes , I do !
Hey , this is really pretty .
- Don' t !
- Whoo !
They' re on our tail .
Fire a gun .
Launch a missile .
Do some damage !

Ow !
Stop that !
Ow !
Just kiddin ' .
I love it rough .
Hit me .
- Uh , computer ?
- [ computer ]
Hi , there .
I' m Eddie , your computer .
I' m pleased to report that it' s a fleet of 100 Vogon battle destroyers .
They' re sending you a message .
This is Vice- President Questular Rontok .
I am speaking to the kidnapper of the President ?
[ Zaphod ]
She digs me .
Surrender the stolen vessel at once or we will take action as defined and permitted by ... section 1- 8 of the Galactic Interstellar Space Bylaws ...
Zaphod , please come back now .
This is ridiculous .
Leap to hyperspace !
Come on !
[ computer ]
Sure thing , fella !
[ engines fire up ]
[ whoosh ]
No .
Did they have proper hyperspace authorization ?
- No , commander .
- Oh .
Bring me the request to pursue fugitive forms .

I' m coming , sir .
- [ footsteps ]
[ panting ]
I' m boiling !
Oh , oh .
Here' s the form , sir .
So are you along for the ride or am I just dropping you somewhere ?
That depends .
Where are you going ?
Where am I going ?
- You okay ?
- Yeah .
Don' t suppose there' s any tea .
Yes , there is .
Come on .
I' il show you the kitchen .
When you see what I' m about to show you , you' il beg me to take you with us .
[ Guide ]
The best drink in existence is the Pan- Galactic Gargle Blaster , the effect of which is like having your brains smashed out by a slice of lemon wrapped round a large gold brick .

Ape- man , Earth dude , sorry , what' s your name again ?

Arthur .
- Right .
Gorgeous .
No hard feelings , okay ?
Sorry to hear about your planet ...
- Earth .
- Yeah .
I liked Earth .
Got these boots there .
But don' t mention it to the girl .
Because if you do ...
I' il pull your spleen out through your throat .
- All right .
Thanks , buddy .
- Okay .
Good stuff .
Like those jammies .
Hey , hey , Zaphod , what' s with the two- head thing ?
Oh , yeah .
Apparently , you can' t be president with a whole brain .
It' s crazy .
- Oh , so you carved it up ?
- Yes .
Parts of my personality weren' t exactly what you' d call presidential .
You know what I' m talkin ' about .
[ drinks machine ]
Your tea is ready .
[ gags ]
[ spits ]
I suppose I should' ve said it resembles tea .
[ laughs ]
So , two heads is what does it for a girl ?
I mean , if I' d had two heads , or three ...
Or your own spaceship .
Anything else he' s got two of ?
Come on , Arthur , don' t be like that .
What am I supposed to be like ?
Green ?
Bleeping ?
I can fold my eyelids inside out if you like .
Okay , look .
Do you see this ?
This detects what you' re craving and makes it for you .
[ machine ]
Enjoy your doughnut .
- Do you see this ?
- [ buzzing ]
This toasts bread while you' re slicing it .
We' re on a spaceship , Arthur .
In space .
- I told you I wanted to get away .
- To Madagascar .
That was ... some sort of test .
And I failed .
- How badly does it hurt ?
- It doesn' t feel great .
No , I mean your chin .
- Ah ...
- I might have an aspirin .
Right .
- [ mice squeak ]
- Hey !
Tricia ...
Trillian , sorry .
There' s something I have to tell you .
- Please , don' t .
- [ Zaphod ]
Showtime , Trill .
I' m going to set up .
Buttons aren' t toys .
Buttons aren' t toys .
Anyway ...
When I saw what I' m about to show you , that' s when I realized why I had to do what I did to my brain .
I think .
It' s all a little ... ... shaky .

[ Guide ]
Many millions of years ago , a race of hyperintelligent , pan- dimensional beings got so fed up with the constant bickering about the meaning of life , that they commissioned two of their brightest and best to design and build a stupendous super- computer to calculate the answer to life , the universe and everything .
O Deep Thought , we want you to tell us the answer .
[ Deep Thought ]
The answer to what ?
[ girl # 2 ]
The answer to life , the universe , everyhing .
[ girl # 1 ]
We' d really like an answer .
Something simple .
[ Deep Thought ]
Hmm , I' d have to think about that .
Return to this place in exactly seven- and- a- half million years .
- [ Ford ]
Is it finished ?
- No , there' s more .
They go back .
- Seven- and- a- half million years later ?
- That' s right , they do .
[ cheering , trumpets ]
Deep Thought , do you have ...
[ Deep Thought ]
An answer for you ?
Yes , but you' re not going to like it .
- It doesn' t matter .
We must know it .
- All right .
The answer to the ultimate question ... [ cheering ]
... of life , the universe and everything ... [ cheering ]
... is ... [ cheering ]
... 42 .
[ man ]
Yeah ?
What ?
[ woman ]
42 ?
[ Deep Thought ]
Yes , I thought it over quite thoroughly .
It' s 42 .
It would' ve been simpler to have known what the question was .
But it was the question .
The ultimate question .
Of everyhing !
That' s not a question .
Only when you know the question will you know what the answer means .
- Give us the ultimate question then .
- I can' t .
But there is one who can .
A computer that will calculate the ultimate question .
A computer of such infinite complexity , that life itself will form part of its operational matrix .
And you yourselves shall take on new , more primitive forms , and go down into the computer to navigate its 1 0- million- year program .
I shall design this computer for you , and it shall be called ...
- That' s it ?
- That' s it .
[ Ford ]
You' re looking for the ultimate question ?
You ?
Why ?
[ Zaphod ]
I tried that .
Why ?
42 .
Doesn' t work .
- Let' s get it ready , baby .
- Why ... ... do you want to know the ultimate question ?
Partly curiosity , partly a sense of adventure , but , uh , mostly I think it' s for the fame and the money .
You' re President of the Galaxy .
- [ Zaphod ]
Yes , Arman .
- Arthur .
Whatever .
Presidential fame is temporary .
I find the question , that' s permanent .
It sticks .
Plus , everyone thinks you' re deep .
Win- win .
We just hit that button and bam , we' re at Magrathea , I think .
We' ve hit it twice and we' re still not there , but anyway ...
- You in ?
- Always .
- [ Zaphod ]
All right !
- [ Marvin ]
Uh , I want to get off .
- Uh , sorry , what exactly are we doing ?
- This !
[ boom ]
[ Guide ]
The Infinite Improbability Drive is a wonderful new method of crossing interstellar distances in a few seconds , without all that tedious mucking about in hyperspace .
As the Improbability Drive reaches infinite improbability , it passes through every conceivable point in every conceivable universe almost simultaneously .
So you' re never sure where you' il end up or even what species you' il be when you get there .
It' s therefore important to dress accordingly .
The Drive was invented following research into finite improbability often used to break the ice at parties by making all the molecules in the hostess ' s undergarments
Ieap one foot to the left in accordance with the theory of indeterminacy .
Many physicists said they wouldn ' t stand for that sort of thing , partly because it debased science , but mostly because they didn ' t get invited to those sort of parties .
[ squeaks and clangs ]
[ engines rumble ]
[ Zaphod ]
Wow , is this gonna happen every time we hit that button ?
[ Trillian ]
Very probably , yes .
[ Marvin ]
Ah , I think the Earthman' s about to be sick .
[ Zaphod ]
In the trashcan , ape- man .
This ship' s new .
Aw , come on !
[ Trillian ]
We have normality .
Did it work ?
Are we there ?
Yeah .
We' re here .
Magrathea !
I don' t think so .
Eddie ...
- Ow !
- What planet is this ?
[ Eddie ]
I' m checking for you .
Did you just pluck one of my hairs ?
Off my head ?
[ Eddie ]
Thank you for waiting .
Sorry to disappoint , but this is not Magrathea .
We are currently in orbit around the planet Viltvodle Six .
- [ squelch ]
- Humma Kavula !
Magrathea' s gonna have to wait .
I got a score to settle on this planet .
- [ engines roar ]
- [ Zaphod ]
Humma Kavula !
[ Guide ]
In the beginning , the universe was created .
This made a lot of people very angry , and is widely regarded as a bad move .
[ crowd shouting ]
Many races believed it was created by some sort of god , though the Jatravartid people of Viltvodle Six firmly believe that the entire universe was sneezed out of the nose of a being called the Great Green Arkleseizure .
[ Zaphod ]
Humma Kavula !
[ Guide ]
The Jatravartids , who lived in fear of the time they called the Coming of the Great White Handkerchief , were small blue creatures with more than 50 arms each .
They were unique in being the only race in history to have invented the aerosol deodorant before the wheel .
Mr President !
Hey , all right .
How you doin ' ?
Hey , what have we here ?
I love it !
[ blasts ]
Hey , I love you .
Fantastic !
You guys related ?
Don' t go changing .
Arthur , I want a drink .
I think I' ve been here before .
Have I been here before ?
[ women ] lxxie !
- I' ve been here before .
- [ Zaphod ]
Humma Kavula !
Come on .
Tricia !
Tricia , I ...

( Now we await with eager expectation ) ( Thy handkerchief to bring us back to Thee )
Hello , Humma .
- [ priest ]
Join us .
Sit down .
- Good to see you .
Thanks .
All right .
[ Humma ]
The handkerchief is coming .
Let us pray the Almighty will exhale a breath of compassion on us all .
So that' s Humma Kavula .
I thought he was just swearing .
We lift our noses , clogged and unblown , in reverence to you .
Send the handkerchief , O Blessed One , so that it may wipe us clean .
We ask this and all things in Thy precious and alliterative name .
[ all sneeze ]
[ all sniffle ]
Bless you .

- [ Zaphod ]
We goin ' in here ?
All right , I like it .
It' s big , it' s gold , it' s fancy .
Fancy pants .
[ Humma ]
Zaphod Beeblebrox , our infamous President .
What brings you to our humble planet ?
[ Zaphod ]
Oh , I think you know why I' m here .
No , I don' t think I do .
I think you think you don' t .
But we both know ... you do .
Eloquent as always .
Your ability to articulate never ceases to amaze .
[ Zaphod ]
That' s funny .
During the campaign , Humma , when you were my opponent running against me , you said I was stupid .
The election is ancient history , Zaphod , but ... ... if memory serves , you won , proving that good looks and charm win over brilliance and the ability to govern .
And , incidentally , you are stupid .
[ Arthur ]
Excuse me , Mr Humma , sir .
Uh , I just want to say , there' s been some sort of terrible mix up
' cause , actually , he' s not with us .
We came to worship you .
He followed us and ...
He grew , didn' t he .
He' s not that tall .
You didn' t come half- way across the galaxy to settle a campaign grudge .
Why are you here ?
Of course not , that' s , that' s ridiculous .
I' ve been stranded on a strange planet for years , I haven' t been avoiding you .
You look great .
You' re doing well .
You' ve grown , obviously .
- [ Zaphod ]
Aggh !
Oomph !
- Wait !
We don' t know why we' re here .
We were trying to get to Magrathea and our ship brought us here .
How very , very improbable .
[ squelch ]
[ electronic buzz ]
I kept a few souvenirs from my former life .
Ah , the heady days of space piracy .
But ... even an lnfinite lmprobability Drive requires coordinates .
Which I happen to have .
- [ Zaphod groans ]
- No , no , no .
You don' t get something for nothing , Zaphod .
You must bring me something in return .
- [ chuckles ]
Wh ...
What ?
- [ Humma ]
A gun .
- A gun ?
- A very special gun .
Designed by the greatest computer ever invented .
But the only way to find it is to go to Magrathea .
Fine .
I' il get your gun .
Just give me the coordinates .
And what will you give me to ensure your return ?
My word as President .
No .
I need a hostage .
Only ... what does Zaphod Beeblebrox treasure ?
- [ Humma whistles ]
- [ gulp ]
- [ whistling ]
- Come on .
[ Zaphod chuckles hysterically ]
Oh , no !
- [ Zaphod ]
Hey , take it easy now .
- [ electric saw ]
No , stop it .
Ah !
Oh , that kind of tickles .
Two heads are better than one .
Double your pleasure .
[ Zaphod' s second head ]
You need me !
Come back !
Come back !
Don' t leave me alone .
[ Hawaiian hula music ]
[ Zaphod' s second head ]
Come back !
[ Arthur ]
I thought I alone considered your boyfriend a narcissistic moron , but the whole galaxy does .
What about you ?
" Excuse me , Mr Humma , sir . "
" We' re not with him .
We just came to worship you . " Very brave .
- Where the hell is Ford ?

By the left , march .

Mr President , we' re here for your protection .
[ Vogon Kwaltz ]

Hey , come on !
The President is the kidnapper .
You' il kill him !
Bang !

[ Arthur ]
It' s locked !
Thank you , darling .
I' il be in touch .
[ Ford shrieks ]
Come on , Zaphod .
- Hey , what did I miss ?
- What have you been doing ?
Field research .
So they found where we are ?
Belgium bummer !
They' re shooting at us !
What are we going to do ?
- [ Trillian ]
I have an idea .
- Pushing him out and running away ?
[ Arthur ]
What ?
He' s the one they want .
You can' t go out there .
What are you doing ?
- Back off !
- [ Vogon ]
What' s going on ?
I have the President and I will kill him , I swear .
- Could that actually kill him ?
- I don' t think so .
- It' s an aerosol can .
- Oh .
[ Arthur ]
Okay , frightened now , frightened .
- [ Zaphod ]
Hi , little guy .
- Get her !
- [ Arthur ]
Zaphod , no , come on !
- [ Trillian ]

Resistance is useless !
[ engines blasting off ]

Bring her to Vogsphere for processing , captain .

Where' s the circus ?
They got her and it' s my fault .
We have to go !
[ Zaphod ]
Let' s go !
Whoo !

What ?
No , no , no .
We' ve got to go after Tricia .
- Who ?
- Trillian .
They' ve got Trillian , you stupid half- brained git !
Right , you' re coming out !
[ laughs hysterically ]
Computer , we don' t want to go to Magrathea , we want to follow the ships .
[ computer ]
I' d love to , but my guidance system has been deactivated .
Oh , come on !
[ computer ]
I' m sorry .
It wasn' t my fault .
What you doing on this ship ?
- Ford ?
- Marvin .
I' ve been talking to the ship' s computer .
And ?
It hates me .
No , uh- uh .
Eddie , computer , is there another way to follow the ships ?

- No , it' s not .
- There is no Magrathea .
- Yes , it is .

They have these on Arcturan megafreighters .
They use them when they need to concentrate .
- What is it ?
- It' s a thinking cap .

There you go .

Should give him some zest for about ten minutes or so .

Now I' m feeling much better about our predicament .

I checked the Guide for how to rescue a prisoner from Vogsphere .
It said don' t .
I' m assuming you have a better plan .
Well , I kind of had this idea that we could ...
Ow !
- Did anyone see that ?
- See what ?
- What was it ?
- [ Arthur ]
Uh ...
Nothing , it' s , uh , nothing .
It' s just my imagination .
Okay , right .
Now , everyone just stop a minute , please , and look at me .
There' s ... definitely something going on here .
Just ... just watch .
Just watch .
Okay , I think we ...
- Oooh !
- Ah- ha !
You too !
Yeah , what was that ?
I thi ...
Zaphod , what do you think ?
I think ...
Ow !

What was that ?
Jeez !
I' d make a suggestion , but you wouldn' t listen .
- No one ever does .
- [ Ford ]
I have an idea .
Ooh , ooh , ooh , Ford !
Kill it !
Get rid of it !
Okay , don' t think .
Nobody think .
No ideas .
No theories .
No nothing .

Ow !
This is crazy .

- We need an idea to save her .

Ooh !
Ah !

You' re supposed to stop .
[ police siren ]
Okay , so I' m not thinking .
Not thinking .
No ideas coming .
Okay , this isn' t an idea that has any merit at all , but , Marvin , can you give me a hand ?
Okay , where is she ? !
Who , the director of robot arm repair ?
Tricia Yggarstuk McMillanus of ...
Blaard ?
No , Tricia Marie McMillan of Earth .
Oh .
Right .

She' s skinny , and she' s pretty , and she' s lying .
- Mmmm .
- [ Vogon clerk ]
Here we are .
Earth .
Oh .
Um , " destroyed . "
Um , do you have a second home planet ?
- Destroyed ?
That' s impossible .
- That' s what it says here .
Says it was destroyed to make way for a hyperspace expressway .
[ electronic pulses ]
[ explosion ]
Who in their right mind gives an order to destroy a planet ?
- He said the gray building , right ?
- All the buildings are gray .
" Give me a hand . " Ha- ha , very funny .
How am I supposed to drive this pod with one arm ?
Stupid human .
[ Vogon clerk # 2 ]
Go and fill that in .
Then , make sure , when you fill in the facilitating form ...
Leave this to me .
I' m British .
I know how to queue .
[ Vogon clerk # 2 ]
If you' d fill that form in for me , and return it as soon as possible .
- Writing implements to your left ...
- You' re President .
Can you do anything ?
Presidents don' t have power .
Their job is to draw attention away from it .
Hey , how you doin ' ?
Hey , it' s me , your President !
What' s goin ' on ?
Thanks for coming .
All right .
I know that sponge .
All right !
- Next !
- President coming through .
How you doin ' , Pinhead ?
No , really , it' s me .

Hi , I' ve come about release of a prisoner .
Prisoner release form .
Oh , wha ... ?
I don' t believe you .
These are the orders .
" Love and kisses " ? !
Mm .
Now , according to the Galactic Penal Code , the punishment for a presidential kidnapping is to be fed to the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal .
Good day .
[ Trillian ]
Ow , get off of me !
Ow !
What the hell is that ?
Ow , no , wait , wait !
There' s been some kind of mistake .
Ah !
- Tick all the boxes on the right .
- Right .
Got it .
Not that one !
[ Guide ]
What to do if you find yourself stuck with no hope of rescue .
Consider how lucky you are that life has been good to you so far .
Alternatively , if life hasn ' t been good to you so far , which , given your current circumstances seems more likely , consider how lucky you are that it won ' t be troubling you much longer .
[ T rillian growls ]
Right , there we go .
Oh , kidnapping the President .
Oh , no , she' s not eligible for release at this time .
Okay .
Right .
Look , this is the President .
- [ Vogon ]
Oh !
- Okay .
See , there ?
He says the kidnapping business was a horrible misunderstanding .
Oh , yeah .
[ Arthur ]
She meant nothing by it .
He' s ordering you to let her go .
But this isn' t a presidential release of prisoner form .
Those are blue .
- I' il stay here .
- All right .
Hold that .
Okay .

Oh , he' s hungry today .

That' s blue .

Okay .

Sir , it' s a release form .
Thank you .
She' s free to go .
- Release her .
- [ Trillian screams ]
Zaphod' s here .
Well , then , uh , that' s fine then .
Let' s just go and get him .
Who are we waiting for again ?
No , I' m serious .
Tricia !
- Tricia .
- [ Zaphod ]

- Hey , come on .
- You idiot !
You signed the order to destroy Earth .
- He did ?
- I did ?
Yes .
" Love and kisses , Zaphod " ?
You didn' t even read it , did you ?
Honey , I' m President of the Galaxy .
I don' t get a lot of time for reading .
An entire planet , my home , destroyed because you thought they wanted your autograph .
- [ Zaphod ]
They framed me !
- Are you an idiot ?
- Trillian .
- You knew .
Why didn' t you tell me ?
- He threatened me .
- Get a backbone , Arthur .
Oh , a backbone ?
What about coming here to rescue you ?
Thank you .
My idea .
Oh !
Stupid !
- Got your arm .
- [ Marvin ]
How considerate .
Right , then , all those lucky enough to have two arms , hold tight .
Oh , the President tests my patience .
This time I shall pursue him myself .

- Can you hand me a towel ?
- Yeah , sure , this ...

Don' t do it !
We' re here .

- Sod it all .
- No !

Wow .
Where are we ?
Exactly where we were .
And the missiles ?
Apparently , they' ve turned ... into a bowl of petunias .
- [ clunk ]
- And a very surprised- looking whale .

And an improbability factor of 8 , 767 , 1 28 to 1 against .
We have norm ... normality .
Normality , right .

We can talk about normality till the cows come home .
- What is normal ?
- What' s home ?
What are cows ?
A proper cup of tea would restore my normality .
[ Guide ]
It is important to note that suddenly , and against all probability , a sperm whale had been called into existence several miles above the surface of an alien planet .
Since this is not a tenable position for a whale , this innocent creature had very little time to come to terms with its identity .
This is what it thought as it fell :
Ah , whoa , what' s happening ?
Who am I ?
Why am I here ?
What' s my purpose ?
What do I mean by who am I ?
Okay , Okay , calm down , get a grip now .
Ooh , this is an interesting sensation .
A sort of tingling in my ...
I better start finding names for things .
Let' s call it a tail .
Yeah , tail .
What' s this roaring sound whooshing past what I' m gonna call my head ?
Wind .
Is that a good name ?
That' il do .
Yay , this is really exciting .
I' m dizzy with anticipation .
Or is it the wind ?
There' s a lot of that now .
And what' s this thing coming towards me very fast ?
So big and flat and round .
It needs a big wide- sounding name like ow , ound , round , ground !
That' s it , ground .
I wonder if it will be friends with me .
Hello , ground .
[ thud ]
[ Guide ]
The only thing that went through the mind of the bowl of petunias as it fell was , " Oh , no , not again ! "
Many have speculated that if we knew why the petunias had thought that , we should know a lot more about the nature of the universe than we do now .
[ wind blows ]
[ Arthur ]
What are those things ?
[ Ford ]
They' re portals to another dimension .
[ Arthur ]
Right .
I don' t suppose this portal has central heating , does it ?

- [ Arthur sighs ]
[ Zaphod ]
Ah , this is the one .
[ Marvin ]
This will all end in tears , I just know it .
- Right here .
- [ machine starts up ]
- Hey !
Whoa !
- [ roaring wind ]
Okay , in we go !
We can' t just step into that ... that !
We don' t know where it leads .
If we pick the wrong one , we just ... we come back , we pick another one .
It' s no biggie .
[ Arthur ]
What ?
Yeah , it' s a big biggie , Ford .
A big biggie .
What if it rips us all into tiny little atomic particle thingies ?
This is the right one .
I have a hunch .
- Ford !
- His hunches are good .
Arthur , I say we go .
Go with the hunch of a man whose brain is fuelled by lemons ? !
[ Arthur ]
This is suicide !
- I think I resent that .
- [ Arthur ]
I don' t care .
[ Zaphod ]
I' m getting hostility from you , Alex ...
- Arthur !
- [ Zaphod ]
Have you ever tried yoga ?
[ portal roars ]
- Trillian !
- I think that' s supposed to happen .
[ High- pitched ]
She' s gone !
Ford , she' s gone !
Arthur , don' t panic !
- Ford !
- [ Zaphod ]
Hey , wait for me !
Whoo !
[ Arthur whimpers ]
Come on .
Idiot !
Come on , come on , come on , come on !
Ahhh !
[ silence ]
[ coughs and splutters ]
[ groans and grunts ]
No , no , no , don' t leave .
Come on , come on , just start !
[ Marvin ]
I told you this would end in tears .
[ Arthur ]
Did you ?
Did you ?
[ Arthur breathes heavily ]
[ Zaphod from above ]
Geronimo !
Ooomph !
[ laughs ]
Far out !
Far out !
Ha- ha !
This is it .
This is it !
Deep Thought .
I' m a- coming .
[ Arthur chuckles ]
So , this is how it' s all going to end , is it ?
Me , alone on a dead planet , with a manically depressed robot .
[ Marvin ]
You think you' ve got problems .
What if you are a manically depressed robot ?
[ man ]
Excuse me .
- [ Arthur ]
Aaaaagghhh !
- [ man ]
Whoa , whoa .
- Who are you ?
- No , uh , my name is not important .
Uh , you must come with me .
- Get away .
- [ man ]
Terrible events are afoot .
Um , you ... you must come or you' il be late .
- [ Arthur ]
Late ?
What for ?
- What ?
No , no .
What' s ... what' s your name , Earthman ?
- Dent .
Arthur Dent .
- [ man ]
Well ...
Iate as in " the late Dentarthurdent . "
It' s a sort of threat , do you see ?
No .
- No .
- [ man ]
Your friends are safe .
- You can trust me .
- A man who won' t tell me his name ?
Okay , my name is , um ... ... my name is ... is ... is ...
Slartibartfast .
I ...
I ...
I said it wasn' t important .
Well ... so my friends are safe ?
Let me show you .
[ Marvin ]
I could calculate your chances of survival , but you won' t like it .
[ clank ]
Did you know we built planets ?
Oh , yes , fascinating trade .
Doing the , um ... doing the coastlines was always my favorite .
We used to have endless fun doing the little fiddly bits around the fjords .
But then the galactic economy collapsed , and seeing that custom- built planets are a ... are a bit of a luxury commodity ...
Come with me because there' s been a terrible mix- up with your planet .
Best laid plans of mice , you know .
- And men .
- What ?
Best laid plans of mice and men .
[ laughs ]
Yes , well , I don' t think men have much to do with it .
Here .
[ vibrations ]
- [ engine starting up ]
- [ beeps ]
[ siren ]
- [ explosion ]
- Um , I must warn you , we' re going to pass through , well , a sort of gateway thing .
- Huh ?
- It may disturb you .
It scares the willies out of me .
Aghh !
Aghh !
[ Slartibartfast ]
Ha , ha , ha .
Welcome to our factory floor .
[ grunts and groans ]
[ Trillian ]
Okay .
[ Zaphod ]
All right .
All right .
Yeah , this is it .
This is it .
O great Deep Thought !
We have traveled long ... ... and far .
Have you calculated the ultimate question of life , the universe and everyhing ?
[ Deep Thought yawns ]
No .
- [ Zaphod ]
What ?
- I' ve been watching TV .
Oh .
I designed another computer to do that .
Oh , right , I forgot .
Is it here ?
No , it' s not here .
It' s another world .
It' s on another world .
It is another world , stupid .
Or it was until the Vogons destroyed it to make way for a hyperspace expressway .
Well ...
Okay .
You sure you don' t have the question , or a way to , you know , access it or something ?
' Cause I think I' ve done a lot to get here .
Oh , shh , shh .
The show' s back on .
[ hiccup ]
Well , I don' t wanna bother you , so I' m gonna ...
Good stuff .
Great .
I' m gonna go and find something else for my entire life to be about .
[ Ford ]
Zaphod , Zaphod , there' s the ... the gun .
- Gun ?
- That Humma sent you for .
- You gave him your head .
- Why' d I ...
Why' d I do that ?
- Okay .
- That' s stupid .
O Deep Thought , we were told that there is a gun .
[ crashing and rumbling ]
[ cart squeals ]
- There you are .
- Hm ?
Look familiar ?
[ Arthur ]
So it wasn' t destroyed ?
Actually , it was .
This is a backup .
Earth Mark ll .
So you ... you made the Earth ?
[ chuckles ]
Not me alone , but I ...
I did my part .
Ever heard of a place , I think it' s called Norway ?
That was one of mine .
I ...
I got an award for it .
[ Arthur shrieks ]
[ Arthur' s shrieks grow louder ]
[ Arthur ]
Oh , hoo !
[ Slartibartfast ]
All right , Frank ?
That' s ... that' s Frank .
Ah- ha .
They ... they' ve nearly finished the oceans .
[ Ford ]
Zaphod .
Here , it' s ... ... it' s just like Humma said .
- Now you can go get your head back .
- Hey , Ford .
It' s been nice knowing you , you zarking frood .
- No !
- [ gun blast ]
- Whoa !
- This is a bust too .
H ...
H ...
Hey , man .
You know , you must really be frustrated .
You go through all you have , you don' t get an answer , which means no money or fame , which you deserve ...
[ Guide ]
The Point- of- View Gun , conveniently , does precisely what its name suggests .
Fantastic .
Fantastic .
Fantastic .
[ Guide ]
If you point it at someone and pull the trigger , they instantly see things from your point of view .
Give me that thing .
It was designed by Deep Thought , but commissioned by a consortium of intergalactic angry housewives who , after arguments with their husbands , were sick of ending those arguments with the phrase ,
" You just don' t get it , do you ? "
[ blast ]
Uh , uh , and you' re right , I shouldn' t be so upset because life goes on , you know , and I should just go on with it .
Shoot him again .
- [ Zaphod ]
Whoa .
- [ blast ]
Hitchhiking' s good .
Towels are good too .
- [ Zaphod ]
Say what ?
- That is brilliant .
[ Zaphod ]
What' s goin ' ... ?
I can see why Humma Kavula would want one of these .
- We better get back .
Arthur' s waiting .
- Who cares ?
I do .
Especially since we' re somewhat of an endangered species , thanks to you .
[ Zaphod ]
Why so edgy , baby doll ?
Relax .
- You wanna know why I' m edgy ?
- [ gun ]
Argh .
Of course you' re edgy .
Your planet' s been blown up and you' ve been tooling around with the guy who signed the order .
Huh ?
Ugh !
You actually wanted to know the question because you always wondered if there was more to life and now you' re crushed because you find out there really isn' t .
Hey , fantastic .
[ laughs ]
Psychedelic .
[ fires again ]
You' ve got no home , no family , and you' re stuck with me , another in a long line of men who doesn' t really get you .
Huh ?
That' s not true .
[ fires twice more ]
And you' re worried you might have blown it with the one guy who really does .
Hey , whoops .
Oh , baby doll .
Give me that thing .
[ sighs ]
It won' t affect me .
I' m already a woman .
[ boom ]
[ rumble of grating stone ]
It' s okay .
It' s only a couple of little mice !
[ huge rumbling ]
[ Slartibartfast ]
Voila !
Himalayas .
Good , eh ?
Earthman , you must realize that the planet you lived on was commissioned , paid for and run by mice .
When you say mice , do you mean the little furry white creatures with whiskers , ears , cheese ?
Yeah , but they' re protrusions into our dimension of hyperintelligent beings .
I don' t know this cheese of which you speak , but they were there on Earth as mice experimenting on you .
I see where you' ve become confused now .
You see , we were experimenting on them .
Ah , no , well , yeah , no .
That' s what they wanted you to think , but you were actually elements in their computer program .
[ Arthur ]
Actually , this explains a lot .
All my life , I' ve had this strange feeling there' s something big and sinister going on in the world .
No , that' s normal paranoia .
Everyone in the universe gets that .
[ boom ]
Perhaps I' m old and tired , but the chances of finding out what' s actually going on are so absurdly remote that the only thing to do is say hang the sense of it and keep yourself busy .
I' d much rather be happy than right any day .
- And are you ?
- Uh ... no .
[ laughs ]
That' s where it all falls down , of course .
Here you are then .
Is this ... ?
It' s , um ...
It' s all there .
You know , it all works .
Welcome home .
[ all cheer ]
- Hey !
- Hey , man !
- There you are !
- Surprise !
What are you doing ?
What happened to you ?
Is that tea ?
- First , our hosts attacked us .
- Right .
But then they made up for it by making us ... [ tearfully ] ... this amazing meal .
It' s so ...
Everyhing' s right .
Everyhing' s delicious .
Oh , come on , that' s lovely .
We' re glad you like it , Earth creature .
[ chuckles nervously ]
The , um , talking ... talking mice .
Cool .
- Sit , Earthman .
- Oh , thank you .
Thank you for that .
- Please , drink .
- Um , uh , excuse me .
- Uh , is there anything else ?
- No , we' re quite happy , thank you .
Um , good , I' il be outside , so ...
You were right .
- [ Mouse ]
Please , drink .
- Yes .
He was right .
Now , to business .
[ both ]
To business !
[ firmly ]
Eat !
- Shh .
- Sorry .
[ Mouse ]
We' ve spent a lot of time on your planet
Iooking for this ultimate question .
Only to have it blow up in our faces .
Literally .
Which is why you' re here .
We' ve been offered a lucrative contract to do several 5- D TV chat shows .
But here' s the point .
We must have product .
We need the ultimate question , or one that sounds ultimate .
- Of course .
- We' ve rebuilt the planet .
Now all we need is the missing piece of the puzzle .
- Which happens to be your brain .
- Right .
[ Mouse ]
More tea ?
Sorry , did you just say you need my brain ?
Yes , to complete the program .
You can' t have my brain .
I' m using it .
- Hardly .
- Hardly ?
Cheeky ...
Cheeky mouse .
Zaphod !
Trillian !
- [ whirring ]
- Ford .
What was in that food ?
What was in my tea ?
Don' t worry .
You won' t feel a thing .
[ grunts and whimpers ]
Just wait a sodding minute .
You want a question that goes with the answer 42 ?
What about , what' s 6x7 ?
Or , um , uh , how many Vogons does it take to change a light bulb ?
Here' s one : how many roads must a man walk down ?
Hey , that' s not bad .
Fine .
Fine , take it , ' cause my head is filled with questions , and no answer to any one of them has ever brought me one iota of happiness .
Except for one .
The one .
The only question I' ve ever wanted an answer to .
Is she the one ?
The answer bloody well isn' t 42 , it' s yes .
Undoubtedly , unequivocally , unabashedly , yes .
And for one week , one week in my sad little ... blip of an existence ... ... it made me happy .
That' s a good answer .
[ mouse ]
We don' t want to be happy .
We want to be famous .
- What' s this " ls she the one " tripe ?
- Take his brain !
No , don' t take the brain !
Don' t take the brain , mice !
[ grunts ]
[ screams ]
- [ screams ]
- It wasn' t me !
- [ gibbers ]
- [ Zaphod ]
I' m famous .
Shoot him , quickly , shoot him !
Oh , bollocks !
Agghh !
I' m gonna be sick .
[ coughs ]
Belgium .
[ voices , vibrations ]
Follow me .
[ Vogons ]
Left , right , left , right .
Attention !
[ Marvin ]
Thanks a lot for leaving me behind .
Though I can' t say I blame you .
Mr President , we' re here for your protection .
Thanks , man .
I appreciate it .
Fire !
No !
No !
[ Marvin ]
What' s all the fuss about ?
Vogons are the worst marksmen in the galaxy .
Ooh .
- For God' s sake , stop !
- Cease fire .
Now I' ve got a headache ... headache ... headache ...
Marvin !
[ Zaphod ]
Oh , no .
- [ Ford' s battle shriek ]
- He' s got a towel , run away !
I' m gonna get us outta here .
How do you drive this thing ?
We need that gun .
Come on .
Get this ship started .
Come on .
Start !
Come on .
Oh , fire , fire !
Fire , fire !
[ Arthur ]
Oo , hoo , hoo , hoo , hoo !
[ Vogon ]
He' s locked it from the other side .
We' il have to go the other way .
Come on , let' s go !
[ shouts ]
Stop !
[ Arthur ]
Oh , no !
[ Zaphod ]
Stop it !
Stop it !
Stop shooting at us !
[ shooting stops ]
Oh , I feel so depressed .
[ Vogons groan ]
I can' t face another day .
What' s the point ?
- You all right ?
- Yeah .
Sorry about your spaceship , Arthur .
[ Vogons groan ]
Marvin , you saved our lives .
I know .
Wretched , isn' t it ?
[ moans ]
You got to ask yourself , what' s the point ?
[ workman ]
Take it away .
You could do all of that , but it' s not gonna ... Well , I' il ask ...
I' il just ask .
I ...
I ...
I' ve just been informed by some of the lads that since we' re so near completion , we' re gonna go ahead and finish Earth .
Oh .
We , well , we can put it back exactly as it was when you left , you know .
Unless there' s , um ... ... there' s , you know , anything you want to change .
Something you think your planet could do without .
Yeah .
Me .
Oh !
Um , hello ?
No , as is .
Yep , leave it .
Yep .
Let' s go somewhere .
Definitely .
Where did you have in mind ?
I know this great restaurant at the end of the universe .
I am a little peckish .
I need to go to Humma' s .
He' s got something of mine .
- I think .
I' m so confused .
- Don' t worry , baby .
We' il sort it out .
All right , let' s trip the light fantastic , baby .
Just you and me .
Come on .
- You got your towel ?
- Yeah .
Why ?
Am I going to need it ?
- Only always .
- Right .
Yeah .
I wouldn' t want to go anywhere without my wonderful towel .
Okay .
Hold tight .
[ speaker ]
Stand by for commencement of life cycle .
In three , two , one ...
[ Zaphod ]
All right !
Whoo !
[ Marvin ]
Not that anyone cares what I say , but the restaurant is at the other end of the universe .

It is , of course , well known that careless talk costs lives .
But the full scale of the problem is not always appreciated .
For instance , at the very moment that Arthur Dent said ,
" I wouldn' t want to go anywhere without my wonderful towel " a freak wormhole opened up in the fabric of the space- time continuum and carried his words far , far back in time , across almost infinite reaches of space , to a distant galaxy where strange and warlike beings were poised on the brink of frightful interstellar battle .
The two opposing leaders , resplendent in their black- jeweled battle shorts were meeting for the last time , when a dreadful silence fell .
And at that very moment , the words " I wouldn ' t want to go anywhere without my wonderful towel " drifted across the conference table .
Unfortunately , in their native tongue , this was the most appalling insult imaginable .
So the opposing battle fleets decided to settle their remaining differences , in order to launch a joint attack on our galaxy , now positively identified as the source of the offending remark .
For thousands of years , the mighty starships tore across the empty wastes of space and finally dived screaming onto the planet Earth , where , due to a terrible miscalculation of scale , the entire battle fleet was accidentally swallowed by a small dog .
Those who study the complex interplay of cause and effect in the history of the universe , say that this sort of thing is going on all the time .
