Help !
Someone help me !
Is someone there ?
Hey !
Oh , shit .
I' m probably dead .
Who' s that ?
Turn on the lights !
What the fuck is going on ?
Where am I ?
Holy shit .
Aaaarghh !
Help !
Help !
Help !
No- one can hear you .
What the fuck is this ?
Calm down .
Just calm down .
Are you hurt ?
I don' t know .
Yeah !
- What' s your name ?
- My name is Very Fucking Confused .
My name is Lawrence Gordon .
I' m a doctor .
I just woke up here , like you .
Aaaarghh !
No .
Do you have any idea how you got here ?
No .
- What' s the last thing you remember ?
- Nothing .
I went to bed in my shit- hole apartment , and woke up in an actual shit- hole .
What about you , huh ?
There' s ...
There' s not much to tell .
I don' t remember anything else .
First dead body I' ve ever seen .
They don' t move .
From the looks of these chains ,
- Can you see any scars ?
- What ?
Man , they kidnap you and drug you .
Before you know , you' re in a bath and your kidneys are on eBay .
No- one has taken your kidneys .
How can you tell from way over there ?
You' d either be in terrible agony , or you' d be dead by now .
Trust me .
So ...
Are you gonna tell me your name , or what ?
Adam .
Well , Adam ...
What we need to do ... is start thinking about why we' re here .
They must want something from us .
The question is , what ?
- It' s brand- new .
- So ?
So ... somebody obviously wanted us to know the time .
What is that ?
Excuse me .
It' s a tape .
- Where did you find it ?
- It was in my pocket .
Come on .
Come on .
Fuck .
No ?
- Use your shirt .
- What ?
- It won' t work .
- Look around .
There must be something else you can use .
- There' s nothing .
- Well , there must be something .
Come on .
Come on .
I don' t get it .
Throw me the player .
No .
You throw me your tape .
Look , we' re gonna have to work together , if we want to get out of here .
Give me that .
Now .
- He knows us .
- Wait a minute .
What do you think ?
Probably a joke , right ?
Shh !
There , right next to you , on the toilet .
Come on .
Come on .
Oh , man !
- Anything ?
- No solids .
Take off the lid .
I really wish I had' ve checked in there first .
Huh !
What is it ?
Hey .
Mind passing me the other one ?
Fuck !
Fuck !
He doesn' t want us to cut through our chains .
He wants us to cut through our feet .
I think I may know who' s done this to us .
What did you say ?
Well , it' s not someone I know personally .
It' s just someone I know of .
Last I heard ... ... the police still hadn' t caught him .
This one' s not fresh any more .
At least three weeks out .
He started at the back and tunnelled through that razor wire so fast , it' s amazing he got as far as he did .
We also found this .
Door was on a timer .
It was unlocked until three o' clock .
Then it slammed shut .
He was given two hours .
You sick fuck !
I think we' re gonna be here for a while , Sing .
Actually , technically speaking , he' s ... not really a murderer .
He never killed anyone .
Help !
Aaaarghh !
I found something else .
Well , two things , actually .
There was someone standing outside , watching through this hole .
Our friend Jigsaw likes to book himself front- row seats to his own sick little games .
Only , this time ... he left us his penlight .
Hm ...
Get a rush on the prints .
Copy that .
This patient has an inoperable frontal lobe tumour extending across the midline .
It started as colon cancer .
The patient has come in for a standard checkup , by which we can monitor the rate at which his condition is declining .
- The patient had ...
- His name is John .
Dr Gordon .
He' s a very interesting person .
Thank you for that information , Zep .
Someone doesn' t want me to tell you what the patient had !
Excuse me .
Dr Gordon .
I' m Detective Tapp , this is Detective Sing .
City homicide .
- Very impressive .
- Oh , thank you .
I do my best .
Now , how can I help you gentlemen ?
Are you able to tell us where you were between the hours of 11 pm and 1 am last night ?
Why is it that you' re interested ?
We' d like to ask a few questions about it .
For your sake , I think it' s best if we do it down at the station .
- Would you like to follow us there ?
- I' m afraid that' s out of the question .
I can' t just leave .
I have work to do .
Plus my wife has the car today .
That' s OK .
You can ride with us .
Doc ?
I' m sorry .
You' il have to tell me again .
What is this all about ?
Is this yours , Doctor ?
Of course not , Brett .
I was seeing someone .
Who ?
Look , if you can' t be honest with me ...
I was visiting someone .
It wasn' t a patient .
What am I gonna do ?
Well , as your lawyer and your friend , my advice to you is to bite the bullet and give them your alibi now ,
That was five months ago .
He tried to set me up for murder .
OK .
We checked your alibi .
It holds up .
Good .
Can I go home now ?
We have one of the victims who managed to escape .
Want to know if you wouldn' t mind sticking around and listening to her testimony .
Maybe it' il trigger something .
- I' d like to help , really , but ...
- Well , we' d appreciate it .
- She' s the only one who made it .
- OK .
Amanda ...
In your own time ... tell me the first thing you remember .
No !
And then I saw the body .
There was a knife .
You mean ... he was alive ?
Was .
What happened after you took it off ?
Most people are so ungrateful to be alive .
But not you .
Not any more .
You are , in fact , a drug addict .
Isn' t that right , Mandy ?
Do you think that is why he picked you ?
He ... helped me .
Are you sure it' s him ?
I' m in exactly the same situation you' re in .
Wrong .
Wrong !
You' ve got one thing I don' t .
Information .
You know who did this .
Now , you either tell me what is really going on , or I' il cut you with this !
I' il cu ...
- What ?
- It' s a two- way mirror .
I can see you .
Don' t look at me .
I can' t help you .
Can you hear me in there ?
Huh ?
I' m having a blast .
This is the most fun I' ve had without lubricant .
Make sure you' re getting everything .
That' s not gonna do anything .
That' s why we can' t cut through these chains or why you won' t break that glass .
Every possible angle has been pre- thought out by him .
You make it sound like you admire this prick .
To overcome something , you have to understand what a perfect engine it is .
That X has to be somewhere in this room .
Help me find it .
How can you be the calm doctor when your wife and kid are out there ?
I' ve been thinking about the last thing I said to my daughter .
Diana , honey , are you OK ?
Diana , honey , can you hear me ?
- Mommy ...
- What is it , sweet pea ?
There' s a man in my room .
Oh , honey , are you sure he' s not just hiding in your imagination ?
He talked to me .
OK .
I' il come and check your room .
I want Daddy .
He' il get the scary man .
All right , if you want .
Come on .
Larry , sorry to bother you , but your daughter had a bad dream again .
Just a minute .
She wants you to check her room .
Mm- hm .
Just got to finish this paragraph .
Come on , sweetie .
I' il check with you .
Nope .
I' m done .
See ?
There' s no- one in your room .
There' s no such thing as the Bad Man .
You are ?
Give me your tootsie .
Oh , what a big tootsie .
Remember this one ?
This little piggy went to market .
This little piggy stayed home .
This little piggy had roast beef .
This little piggy had none .
This little piggy ran ...
Whee !
All the way home !
I hate that thing .
Well , I have to go to work , sweetheart .
You know what Daddy' s job is like .
Now , come on .
Let' s see .
Try and get some sleep , now , OK ?
You' re not gonna leave us , are you , Daddy ?
What ?
What are you talking about ?
You mean , leave you and Mommy ?
No .
No , sweetheart .
I ...
I would never do that .
- Who gave you that idea ?
- No- one .
Well , it' s not true .
OK ?
- Love you very much .
- That' s right .
That' s right .
- Good night , sweetie .
- Good night , Daddy .
Tomorrow ...
I' il read you your favourite story .
OK .
- What are you talking about ?
- How can you pretend you' re happy ?
- I am happy .
- That is complete bullshit .
Would you like to see her ?
You gonna have any more kids ?
Ah , we' ve ... talked about it , but er ... ... with our schedules , it' s difficult enough to concentrate on one .
So , where' s the lucky wife ?
There' s another picture behind the one you' re looking at .
Someone , usually me , has to hold the camera ,
It' s er ...
It' s not here .
What ?
This photo you' re talking about' s not here .
Really ?
Are you sure ?
Yeah .
Just ...
Why , he ... he must have taken it .
I ...
- I am happy .
- That is complete bullshit .
I' d rather you just tell me you hate me .
At least there would be some passion in it .
We' il talk about this later .
OK ?
Just leave .
Diana ?
Diana ?
Diana !
Shh .
Don' t you dare !
Get away from her !
Mommy !
Mommy !
Mommy !
Mommy !
Get your fucking hands off my daughter !
Get off of her !
Huh !
I never should have let you go .
- We checked your alibi , it holds up .
- Isn' t that right ?
Here we are .
That was er ... quite an amazing story that poor woman told .
Look , I' m ...
I' m sorry I can' t be of more help to your investigation .
You know , we arrested a dentist last week .
He liked to play with kids a bit too much .
He lived two blocks from here .
- Hey , Tapp .
- Hmm ?
We' re gonna go down to get a beer .
You want to come ?
I don' t think so .
But thank s , anyway .
Well , you know , I always ask .
Hey , Tapp .
I don' t mean for this to be disrespectful .
Maybe you should find yourself a girlfriend .
Wait , wait , wait .
Sing .
- Get back here .
- What ?
What ?
Remember 118th Street ?
Er ...
K2K .
That gang' s territory was only about four block s .
Now , listen to this .
Check the records for all fire emergencies in that area within the last two week s .
Mmm !
It' s an old listing .
Used to be a mannequin factory .
Think we have enough for a warrant , though ?
Who said anything about a warrant ?
Right now ?
Why not ?
Yeah , why not ?
At least we' il have the cover of darkness .
Yeah , well , so will anybody else .
I got you .
What the hell is this ?
Shit .
Oh , fuck !
Wait , Sing .
Let' s see what he' s gonna do .
- Why ?
We fuckin ' got him .
- We don' t know what he looks like .
- Let' s see what he' s gonna do .
- No fucking way .
Fuck that .
I' m gonna take him .
What the fuck ?
Shit !
Awake already , Jeff ?
I need more- powerful tranquillizers next time .
Don' t cry .
I' ve given your life a purpose .
You' re a test subject for something greater than yourself .
Freeze !
- Hold it right there !
- Put your hands in the air !
Now you' il make a choice .
In 20 seconds , the life of this man will be ended .
- Get down here !
- Turn it off !
Fine .
Move !
- How do you turn it off ?
- Tell him , asshole !
One key will unlock it .
- Where is it ?
- It' s in the box .
- Box ?
Fuck !
- Which key ?
Which key ?
- Tell him which key it is !
- Time' s running out .
- Shut up and get down here !
What' s more important to you , Officer ?
Arresting me or the life of a human being ?
Get down on your knees , asshole !
Hands behind your head !
- Tapp !
- Sick bastard !
- Yes , I' m sick , Officer .
- Tapp , there' s a hundred keys here !
Sick from the disease eating away at me inside .
Sick of people who don' t appreciate their blessings .
Sick of those who scoff at the suffering of others .
I' m sick of ' em all !
Tapp !
No !
No !
Tapp !
Tapp !
Shit !
You' re OK .
Let me see .
I' il be back .
I' m gonna be back , OK ?
I' il be back .
Freeze , or I' il shoot !
I had you .
I had you on your knees .
But you' re running .
You' re running .
You' re running scared cos ... cos we had you .
We' re gonna close this case .
Gonna close it .
Right , Sing ?
Right ?
We' re gonna close it , Sing .
Just because I' m stuck in this room with you
I really don' t see the point in us not helping one another .
That' s exactly why we need to talk and think .
- I am thinking !
- Then don' t keep me in the dark
Turn off the lights .
Turn them off now , please .
- Why ?
- Just turn them off for a second .
Jesus .
Behind you .
How come we didn' t see that before ?
The lights in here hadn' t charged it .
It' s glow- in- the- dark paint or something .
- Open it !
- It' s locked .
The key ... the one from my envelope .
Where is it ?
Where the fuck ?
Here .
A cellphone .
Give me that .
Yes .
I' m willing to risk it .
May I please have a cigarette ?
I' m trying the police .
Shit .
This was meant to receive calls , not make them .
This has happened before .
Great .
That ... thing ... was waiting for me .
How did you know to turn off the lights ?
- Who cares ?
It worked .
- Yeah , but how did you know ?
Instinct .
Instinct ?
You' re a terrible liar .
You say that like you know me .
What else aren' t you telling me ?
Well , um , let' s see ...
On my sixth birthday , my best friend at the time , Scott Tibbs ,
My last girlfriend , a feminist vegan punk ,
- One of my toenails is slightly ...
- Just stop it !
You knew to turn off these lights .
- Whatever .
- I' m dealing with a juvenile .
- You wanna know ?
- Yeah !
Here it is .
Come .
Oh , God .
W- Where did you get this ?
It was in your wallet .
- Why didn' t you show me this before ?
- I couldn' t .
I' m sorry .
What are you doing to them , you bastard ?
OK .
OK .
OK .
I' ve got to think now .
Hey , what the hell are you doing ?
So , you er ...
You still want that cigarette ?
Um ... yeah .
Sure .
There !
I' ve done it !
Now where' s my family ?
Where are they ?
Aaaaargh !
- Aagh !
Jesus Christ !
- What are you ... ?
L- l- I just got electrocuted !
What ?
Jesus .
That was our way out !
Did you hear what I said ?
Get this thing off me !
You think I would make that up just to mess up your stupid fucking charade ?
Damn it !
I remember everything now .
I remember how I got here .
Oh ...
Great .
Is someone there ?
I can hear you .
Huh !
What the ... ?
What the Christ ... ?
What the ... ?
Huh !
Who is that ?
Who' s in there ?
Come out !
I' il kill you , you motherfucker !
Aagh !
Who is this ?
Diana .
Daddy , is that you ?
Yeah , baby , it' s me .
I' m here .
L- I' m scared , Daddy .
Don' t worry , honey .
Everything' s gonna be OK .
Let me talk to her , sweetie .
OK ?
Put Mommy on .
The bad man from my room is here .
And he has a gun .
Wh- What man ?
Hello ?
Hello ?
Diana ?
Diana !
Larry .
Ali ?
Is that you ?
Is Adam there ?
Ali ...
What is going on ?
Don' t believe Adam' s lies .
Hello ?
Ali ?
Ali ?
Hello !
Goddamn you !
If you so much as lay a finger on them , I' il kill you .
You hear me , you son of a bitch ?
I' il kill you !
Damn !
Are they OK ?
My wife , she er ...
She mentioned your name .
What did she say ?
She told me ... not to believe you .
Believe me about what ?
She told me you knew me .
Who are you ?
You know who I am .
Stop the lies !
You' re a liar !
I need to know the truth !
I' m a liar ?
What did you do last night , Lawrence ?
You told me that after you left your house last night ,
Your wife is right , Larry .
I can prove that you didn' t go anywhere near a hospital last night .
It' s not the first time I' ve done it either , Larry .
I get paid to take pictures of rich guys like you , who go to seedy motels to fuck their secretaries .
You' ve er ... had these with you the whole time ?
I found them in there with the hack saws .
- Right !
You' re so full of it !
- Face it , Larry , we' re both bullshitters !
It only shows you what' s put right in front of it .
Just out of curiosity , what did you do in that motel room ?
Why did you um ... deem it necessary to page me when you knew I was at home ?
I didn' t know if you were going to make it .
I gave you a precise time at which to page me .
You can' t do that .
It' s not like I know the rules for this sort of stuff .
- What' s wrong , Dr Gordon ?
- Look , um ...
It was wrong of me to make you come here .
- But I thought we' ve ...
- No , no .
Please .
I' m sorry .
You tell anyone you were here ?
No .
Hello .
- It' s for you .
- For me ?
Hello .
I ...
I have to go .
- What happened ?
- I gotta go .
Who was it ?
Who was what ?
The person who paid you to follow me .
Who was it ?
He calls himself Bob and he gives me the money upfront .
200 bucks a night .
If I' d known I' d end up here , I' d have asked for a lot more .
What does that mean ?
Does that mean you saw what happened to me ?
What I saw was you get into your car .
That' s it .
I don' t know how I got here .
I don' t know how you got here .
Next thing I know , I' m chained to a pipe in some prehistoric bathroom , staring at the guy I' ve been taking shots of .
Clearly , whoever paid you to take pictures of me is the one who put us here .
Maybe .
Of course it is !
What did he look like ?
- I don' t take notes .
- You must remember something about him .
- I can' t .
- You don' t remember a thing about the guy ?
- I told you , I ...
- For fuck' s sake !
I give up !
He' s a tall black guy .
He' s got a scar around his neck , OK ?
Tapp .
No , no .
He was discharged from the police force .
He broke down after his partner was killed .
He' s convinced I must have somehow been involved with the murders .
He' s crazy .
And you helped him .
You took money from him to invade my privacy .
How could you do that ?
Right .
You know what , Adam , you' re not a victim of this game .
This cop thinks you' re the one behind it all .
I told you , he' s not a cop .
He' s a bottom feeder , just like you !
What are you pissed off about ?
The fact I took shots of you or the fact that I took shots of you while you cheated on your wife ?
I don' t give a crap if you covered yourself in peanut butter and had a 15- hooker gangbang .
How did I get here ?
I had ...
I had everything in order .
My whole life was in perfect order .
Sweetheart , are you OK ?
Mommy just needs you to be really , really , really , really strong right now .
I' m not gonna let anybody hurt you .
OK .
That' s my good girl .
I know him .
His name is Zep .
He' s an orderly at my hospital .
Zep .
I' m gonna take great pleasure in seeing you pay for this ,
Look .
We' re out of time .
Shh , sweetie ... sweetie .
- Mommy , help me !
- Ssh ...
Dr Gordon' s time is up .
Now I' ve got to do what I' ve got to do , and ... ... I' m afraid it has to be you that tells him he failed .
Is that you , Zep , you bastard ?
I know it' s you , you son of a bitch !
Ali ?
You failed .
Hello ?
Hello ?
- You !
- Wait .
Don' t move !
Stay on the ground .
Give me ...
Give me the phone .
Give it to me !
Larry ?
Ali !
Honey , are you all right ?
No ...
No , we' re not .
Get down !
- Larry , where are you ?
- I don' t know .
I' m being held captive in a room somewhere .
Wh- What are you talking about ?
Forgive me .
I' ve always been happy with you .
Mommy !
Aagh !
Jesus !
Ali !
Ali !
Ali !
Mommy !
Aargh !
Aaargh !
Freeze !
What the fuck ?
- Yaaaa !
- Ya !
Argh !
Urgh !
Mrs Gordon ?
Diana !
I' m gonna kill your husband now , Mrs Gordon .
Lawrence !
Lawrence , get up !
Lawrence !
Get up !
Oh , thank God .
I thought you were dead .
He ...
He ...
He electrocuted me .
I told you .
The same thing happened to me .
See ?
Fuck this shit !
No !
Lawrence , calm down .
- There must be a way out of this .
- Shut up !
Just shut up !
My family needs me !
No !
God !
God !
No !
Argh !
Lawrence !
I have a family too .
I don' t see them , that' s my mistake .
It' s a mistake I' d like to fix .
I' m gonna kill you , you sick asshole .
Stop it .
There' s a way out of here .
There' s a way out !
Lawrence !
No !
What are you ...
No !
Oh , my God !
Lawrence !
What are you doing ?
What ... are you doing ?
What are you ...
What are you ...
Oh , my God !
Oh , my God !
Lawrence !
It' s not me who did this to you !
- You have to die .
- No !
I want to live !
- I' m sorry .
- I want to live !
- My family ...
- Argh !
There !
I' ve done it !
Now show them to me !
Show them to me .
- Thank you very much , Officer .
- Larry ?
Did you get through to him ?
- There' s still no answer .
- I' ve called the police .
Everything is OK .
I' il fucking kill you !
I' il fucking kill you !
You fucking bastard !
I' il fucking kill you !
You fucking bastard !
I' il fucking kill you !
I' il fucking kill you .
- Why ?
- It' s the rules .
Argh !
You' re gonna be all right .
You' re just wounded ... wounded in the shoulder .
I have to go and get help .
If I don' t g- get help ...
I' m going to bleed to death .
Don' t leave me !
No !
No !
No !
No !
Ow !
D- Don' t worry .
I promise .
Lawrence !
Lawrence !
We' re gonna be OK ?
I wouldn' t lie to you .
Key .
Key .
Key !
Dr Gordon' s time is up .
Mrs Gordon !
- Why ?
- It' s the rules .
The key to that chain is in the bathtub .
He' s a very interesting person .
His name is John .
He has an inoperable frontal- lobe tumour .
He books himself front- row seats to his own sicko games .
Game over .
Argh !
Argh !
Don' t !
Don' t !
Don' t !
Argh !
