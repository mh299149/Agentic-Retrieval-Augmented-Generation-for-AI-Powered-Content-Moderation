- [do] Some men do .
the mind can start to fill with strange thoughts , doubts .
Don' t you ever have doubts , Vaako ?
- Doubts ?
- About the campaign .
About Lord Marshal .
First and always , I am a Necromonger commander .
So if you' re here to test my loyalty , you succeed only in testing my patience .
Oh , no .
No , that' s not why I' m here at all .
Doesn' t it strike you odd ?
to kill one stranded Elemental .
Why is that ?
You don' t pray to our god .
You pray to no god , I hear .
Elementals -- we calculate .
Don' t we all .
But now let' s have first things first .
What of Riddick ?
In truth , I don' t know where he went .
In truth , I' m more interested in where he came from .
Watch your step .
I' ve always wondered , does an air Elemental fly ?
Calculate the odds of you getting off this planet alive ... and now cut them in half .
No , we can' t fly .
But we glide very well .
I would have told you about Riddick for the asking .
It concerns a foretelling , a prediction now more than 30 years old .
Furya ?
Furya' s a ruined world .
No life to speak of .
For good reason .
This young warrior mounted an attack on Furya , killing all young males he could find , even strangling some with their birth cords .
An artful stroke , wouldn' t you say ?
So this warrior , the one who tried to outwit the prediction , would later become --
That' s why he worries .
The Lord Marshal .
Which would make the man- child --
He worries he missed killing that child in its crib .
Riddick .
Wait .
- Wait !
Wait !
Are you there ?
You do what your lord asks .
You cleanse Riddick for him , and in doing so ... you prove your undying loyalty .
And perhaps then he' il finally let down his guard .
I' ve been here 1 8 years .
See this ?
I remember how gorgeous she was .
Well , gorgeous in a certain light .
And now , for the goddamn death of me ,
I cannot remember her name .
Feeding time !
We' re here for the rest of our unnatural lives .
Here they come !
Whatever you do , don' t make eye contact .
Aaah !
It' s an animal thing .
- Hyah !
I' d take my wounded and go while you still can .
Is there a name for this private little world of yours , huh ?
What happens there when we don' t just run away ?
Tea , actually .
What' s that ?
I' il kill you with my teacup .
You know the rule .
They aren' t dead if they' re still on the books .
Mmm .
Come on .
Death by teacup .
Damn .
Why didn' t I think of that ?
But it' s my favorite game .
Haven' t you heard ?
I heard you came lookin ' for me .
Then you missed the good part .
Hooked up with some mercs outta Lupus Five .
They slaved me out , Riddick .
When you' re 1 2 years old ?
I told you to stay in New Mecca .
Did you not listen ?
I had mercs on my neck .
I' il always have mercs on my neck .
I spent five years on a frozen heap just to keep ' em away from you .
And you go and sign up with the same fake badges ... that wanted to cut you up and use you for bait .
What are you pitching , Riddick ?
That you cuttin ' out was a good thing ?
That you had my ass covered from halfway across the universe ?
You signed with mercs .
There was nobody else around .
Let' s pop the cork .
Get some fresh air .
So they do go topside ... to swap out air .
Interesting .
Who the hell are you ?
When it happens , it' il happen fast .
for the rest of your natural life .
Nobody outs this place .
Nobody .
We' il cut you in for 77 5K .
Well , all right .
What' s the bad news ?
They close the local whorehouse ?
Our pilot , he saw this .
It crossed a shipping lane .
Never saw nothin ' like it .
You know , Anatoli' s got a nose for trouble ,
There is no way we didn' t lose them .
Nobody else' s .
And I want my money now .
you stole a prisoner ...
No .
Shoulda taken the money , Toombs .
You gonna kill me ?
Mercs .
Some guards here , but this can' t be all of them .
Guards ain' t there .
Plan was to clean the bank , ghost the mercs , break wide through the tunnel .
And then somebody got a lucky shot off with this rocket launcher here ... and took out the sled .
Guards took off on foot but rigged the door so no one could follow .
How come you know all this shit ?
You weren' t even here .
' Cause it was my plan .
I shoulda taken the money .
Riddick !
- We' il last five minutes .
Five minutes .
We ain' t gonna last 30 seconds out there .
It' il light you up like a match .
20- mile buffer zone and 30 klicks to the hangar .
30 klicks over that terrain ?
It' s moving in the right direction .
We could make it .
Stay behind the night , ahead of the sun .
There' s gonna be one speed -- mine .
You' il just die .
Riddick ?
Riddick ?
Go , go !
Go on !
Go !
Climb here !
Climb !
Go !
Go , go , go !
Boss !
- Take a look .
- Because Anatoli says so ?
Because his nose says so .
There' s nothin ' up here .
Oh , shit .
Riddick .
No chance do they get to the hangar first .
No chance !
Next one !
Next hole !
We' il catch ' em there !
Where did the big guy go ?
- Ohh --
Close it !
If I kill them first , not really .
Maybe I do .
Keep moving !
- Kyra !
- What ?
Get that ass moving !
Riddick ?
Remember what I said about not caring if I lived or died ?
You knew I was kidding , right ?
Temperature differential .
Your rope .
It' s too late .
We' re never gonna make it .
Your rope !
Gimme your rope !
And your water .
All of it !
Stay in the shadow of the mountain .
Don' t wait for me .
Run !
Riddick !
Aaah !
Where the hell is that hangar ?
- Listen .
Let me guess .
Necros .
And a whole lotta Necro firepower .
I figure we got three minutes before the sun hits us again , burns out this whole valley .
- Wait .
- We gonna do this or not ?
Just wait .
Ellen .
Her name was Ellen .
I never really forgot .
Aaah !
Boss !
- Remember that favorite game of yours ?
- Let' s play .
- Come on !
On the right !
Watch out !
Behind you !
Sybar !
Aaah !
you can kneel .
I think you know who tore Furya apart .
This mark carries the anger of an entire race .
But it' s going to hurt .
Kyra ?
if Vaako failed to kill you .
A message from the Lord Marshal himself .
He tells you to stay away from Helion , stay away from him , and in return , you' il be hunted no more .
But Vaako will most likely report you as dead .
So this is your chance .
Your chance to do what no man has ever done .
The girl .
Where will they take her ?
We all began ... as something else .
I' ve done ... unbelievable things ... in the name of a faith that was never my own .
And he' il do to her what he did to me .
The Necromonger in me warns you not to go back .
But the Furyan in me ...
hopes you won' t listen .
God knows ...
I' ve dreamed of it .
It is overdue , isn' t it -- that we acknowledge your many accomplishments , and above all , your unflinching loyalty .
Obedience without question .
Loyalty till UnderVerse come .
Well done , Vaako .
This is a day of days .
Look more pleased , Vaako .
You have killed his enemy ... and his suspicions .
- I should have brought back his head .
- You saw him unbreathing .
You saw him dead on the ground .
Riddick was no common breeder .
In a heartbeat he dropped 20 of my men .
All mysteries are not miracles , not even in this religion .
And if you say it is certain , then it is certain , and we' ve already said it , haven' t we ?
We have .
Tell me the Furyan is gone , and I can close this campaign without hearing his bootsteps .
If he is dead ,
I sense I' m not far from the same fate , being of no further use here .
Shouldn' t I tell you that Riddick is still alive ?
Don' t try me , Aereon .
I could plow you under with the rest of Helion Prime .
No one really knows the future .
Then tell me the odds that Vaako met with success , that I will now be the one ... who can carry his people across the threshold into UnderVerse , where they shall begin true life .
Tell me what I want to hear , Aereon , and maybe I' il save your home world ... for last .
- The odds are good ...
- That ? that you will reach the UnderVerse ...
Ascension protocol !
We still have numbers out there , Lord Marshal -- sweep teams , recon ships .
They would be hard- pressed to make it back --
Get my armada off the ground !
- You mean on Helion ?
- I mean here , on this very ship !
Could you be wrong ?
Mind fabricates fear .
Could you be wrong ?
Not so wrong as you when you left him alive !
It' s twice a mistake .
Not only your failure , but now the report of success .
How do we salvage this ?
How ?
How ?
Lord Marshal' s got to be warned .
You will never see the UnderVerse !
He will kill us both before our due time .
I say give Riddick his chance .
If he is half of what you think , he can at least wound the Lord Marshal -- and that is when you must act .
Just to take his place ?
Just to keep what I kill ?
- That is the Necromonger way .
- It is not enough !
Then you do it for the faith !
If he has fear , he has weakness .
If he has weakness , Vaako --
He is unworthy of lordship .
We do it for all Necromongers .
Protect the faith .
This can still be a day of days , but the timing ... must be flawless .
Final protocol .
Execute on my order .
Go inside .
Are they leaving now ?
Ziza !
Go inside !
Commander Toal .
He won' t escape twice .
- Stay your weapons !
He came for me .
you' il never rise .
and rise again in the UnderVerse .
Go to him .
It hurts ... at first .
But after a while , the pain goes away , just as they promise .
- Are you with me , Kyra ?
- There' s a moment ... when you can almost see the UnderVerse through his eyes .
It makes it sound perfect -- a place where anyone can start over .
Are you with me , Kyra ?
Convert now ... or fall forever .
You killed everything I know .
Vaako .
Not yet .
Been a long time since I' ve seen my own blood .
These are his last moments .
Give me your soul .
- Fuck you !
You' re not the one to bring me down .
Now !
Kill the beast while he' s wounded !
Help me , Vaako .
Kill him .
Vaako ?
Forgive me .
Flawless .
No .
No- o- o !
Now what would be the odds of that ?
I thought you were dead .
Are you with me , Kyra ?
I was always with you .
I was .
You keep what you kill .
