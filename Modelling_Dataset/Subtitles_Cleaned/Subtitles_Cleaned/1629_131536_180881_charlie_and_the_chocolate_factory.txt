- [a] This is a story of an ordinary little boy ... ... named Charlie Bucket .
He was not faster or stronger or more clever than other children .
His family was not rich or powerful or well- connected .
In fact , they barely had enough to eat .
Charlie Bucket was the luckiest boy in the entire world .
He just didn' t know it yet .
- Evening , Buckets .
- Evening .
Hi , Dad .
Soup' s almost ready , darling .
Don' t suppose there' s anything extra to put in , love .
Oh , well .
Nothing goes better with cabbage than cabbage .
Charlie ... ... l found something I think you' il like .
Charlie' s father worked at the local toothpaste factory .
The hours were long , and the pay was terrible ... ... yet occasionally , there were unexpected surprises .
It' s exactly what I need .
What is it , Charlie ?
Dad found it , just the piece I needed .
- What piece was it ?
- A head for Willy Wonka .
Well , how wonderful .
It' s quite a likeness .
- You think so ?
- Think so ?
I know so .
I saw Willy Wonka with my own two eyes .
- I used to work for him , you know .
- You did ?
- I did .
- He did .
He did .
I love grapes .
Of course , I was a much younger man in those days .
Willy Wonka began with a single store on Cherry Street .
But the whole world wanted his candy .
- Mr. Wonka .
- Yeah ?
We need more Wonka bars ...
- ... and we' re out of chocolate birds .
- Birds ?
Birds .
Well , then we' il need to make some more .
Here .
Now open .
The man was a genius .
Did you know he invented a new way of making chocolate ice cream ... ... so that it stays cold for hours without a freezer ?
You can even leave it lying in the sun on a hot day , and it won' t go runny .
- But that' s impossible .
- But Willy Wonka did it .
Before long ... ... he decided to build a proper chocolate factory .
The largest chocolate factory in history .
Fifty times as big as any other .
Grandpa , don' t make it gross .
Tell him about the lndian prince .
He' d like to hear about that .
You mean , Prince Pondicherry ?
Well , Prince Pondicherry wrote a letter to Mr. Wonka ... ... and asked him to come all the way out to lndia ... ... and build him a colossal palace entirely out of chocolate .
It will have 1 00 rooms , and everything will be made of either dark or light chocolate .
True to his word , the bricks were chocolate ... ... and the cement holding them together was chocolate .
All the walls and ceilings were made of chocolate as well .
So were the carpets and the pictures and the furniture .
It is perfect in every way .
Yeah , but it won' t last long .
You better start eating right now .
Oh , nonsense .
I will not eat my palace .
I intend to live in it .
But Mr. Wonka was right , of course .
Soon after this , there came a very hot day with a boiling sun .
The prince sent an urgent telegram requesting a new palace ... ... but Willy Wonka was facing problems of his own .
All the other chocolate makers , you see , had grown jealous of Mr. Wonka .
They began sending in spies to steal his secret recipes .
Fickelgruber started making an ice cream that would never melt .
Prodnose came out with a chewing gum that never lost its flavor .
Then Slugworth began making candy balloons ... ... that you could blow up to incredible sizes .
The thievery got so bad ... ... that one day , without warning ... ... Mr. Wonka told every single one of his workers to go home .
He announced that he was closing his chocolate factory forever .
I' m closing my chocolate factory forever .
I' m sorry .
But it didn' t close forever .
It' s open right now .
Yes , well , sometimes when grownups say " forever , " they mean " a very long time . "
Such as , " I feel like I' ve eaten nothing but cabbage soup forever . "
- Now , Pops .
- The factory did close , Charlie .
And it seemed like it was going to be closed forever .
Then one day we saw smoke rising from the chimneys .
- The factory was back in business .
- Did you get your job back ?
No .
No one did .
But there must be people working there .
Think about it , Charlie .
Have you ever seen a single person ... ... going into that factory or coming out of it ?
No .
The gates are always closed .
Exactly .
But then , who' s running the machines ?
- Nobody knows , Charlie .
- It certainly is a mystery .
Hasn' t someone asked Mr. Wonka ?
Nobody sees him anymore .
He never comes out .
The only thing that comes out of that place is the candy ... ... already packed and addressed .
I' d give anything in the world just to go in one more time ... ... and see what' s become of that amazing factory .
Well , you won' t , because you can' t .
No one can .
It' s a mystery , and it will always be a mystery .
That little factory of yours , Charlie , is as close as any of us is ever going to get .
Come on , Charlie .
I think it' s time we let your grandparents get some sleep .
- Good night , Grandpa George .
- Night , Charlie .
- Night- night .
- Chair .
Thank you , dear .
Night , Grandpa Joe .
Good night , Grandma Georgina .
Nothing' s impossible , Charlie .
- Good night .
- Night , Charlie .
Sleep well .
Indeed , that very night , the impossible had already been set in motion .
Dear people of the world ... ... I , Willy Wonka ... ... have decided to allow five children to visit my factory this year .
In addition , one of these children shall receive a special prize ... ... beyond anything you could ever imagine .
Five golden tickets have been hidden ... ... underneath the ordinary wrapping paper of five ordinary Wonka bars .
The bars may be anywhere ... ... in any shop , in any street , in any town , in any country in the world .
Wouldn' t it be something , Charlie , to open a bar of candy ... ... and find a golden ticket inside ?
I know , but I only get one bar a year , for my birthday .
Well , it' s your birthday next week .
You have as much chance as anybody does .
Balderdash .
The kids who are going to find the golden tickets ... ... are the ones who can afford to buy candy bars every day .
Our Charlie gets only one a year .
He doesn' t have a chance .
Everyone has a chance , Charlie .
Mark my words , the kid who finds the first ticket ... ... will be fat , fat , fat .
Augustus .
This way .
I am eating the Wonka bar ... ... and I taste something that is not chocolate ... ... or coconut ... ... or walnut or peanut butter ... ... or nougat ... ... or butter brittle or caramel or sprinkles .
So I look ... ... and I find the golden ticket .
Augustus , how did you celebrate ?
I eat more candy .
We knew Augustus would find the golden ticket .
He eats so many candy bars a day ... ... that it was not possible for him not to find one .
Yes , it is good , Augustus . -- golden ticket claimed and four more ....
Told you it' d be a porker .
What a repulsive boy .
Only four golden tickets left .
Now that they' ve found one , things will really get crazy . -- of every shape , size and hue .
Veruca .
Can you spell that for us , please ?
V- E- R- U- C- A. Veruca Salt .
As soon as my little Veruca told me she had to have one of these golden tickets ... ... l started buying all the Wonka bars I could lay my hands on .
Thousands of them .
Hundreds of thousands .
I' m in the nut business , you see .
So I say to my workers :
Morning , ladies .
From now on , you can stop shelling peanuts ... ... and start shelling the wrappers off these chocolate bars instead .
Three days went by , and we had no luck .
Oh , it was terrible .
My Veruca got more and more upset each day .
Where' s my golden ticket ?
I want my golden ticket .
Well , gentlemen , I just hated to see my little girl feeling unhappy like that .
I vowed I would keep searching until I could give her what she wanted .
And finally , I found her a ticket .
Daddy , I want another pony .
She' s even worse than the fat boy .
I don' t think that was really fair .
She didn' t find the ticket herself .
Don' t worry about it , Charlie .
That man spoils his daughter .
And no good ever comes from spoiling a child like that .
Charlie , Mum and I thought ... ... maybe you wanna open your birthday present tonight .
Here you are .
Maybe I should wait till morning .
- Like hell .
- Pop .
All together , we' re 381 years old .
We don' t wait .
Now , Charlie , you mustn' t feel too disappointed ... ... you know , if you don' t get the ....
Whatever happens , you' il still have the candy .
Ah , well .
That' s that .
- We' il share it .
- Oh , no , Charlie .
Not your birthday present .
It' s my candy bar , and I' il do what I want with it .
Thank you , darling .
Thank you , Charlie .
Bless you .
All right , let' s see who found it .
" The third ticket was found by Miss Violet Beauregarde . "
These are just some of the 263 trophies and medals my Violet has won .
I' m a gum chewer mostly , but when I heard about these ticket things ... ... l laid off the gum , switched to candy bars .
She' s just a driven young woman .
I don' t know where she gets it .
I' m the Junior World Champion Gum Chewer .
This piece of gum I' m chewing right now ... ... l' ve been working on for three months solid .
That' s a record .
Of course , I did have my share of trophies , mostly baton .
So it says that one kid' s gonna get this special prize , better than all the rest .
I don' t care who those other four are .
That kid , it' s gonna be me .
Tell them why , Violet .
Because I' m a winner .
What a beastly girl .
Despicable .
You don' t know what we' re talking about .
Dragonflies ?
But wait , this is just in .
The fourth golden ticket has been found by a boy called Mike Teavee .
All you had to do was track the manufacturing dates ... ... offset by weather and the derivative of the Nikkei lndex .
A retard could figure it out .
Most of the time I don' t know what he' s talking about .
You know , kids these days , what with all the technology ....
Die !
Die !
Die !
Doesn' t seem like they stay kids very long .
ln the end , I only had to buy one candy bar .
- And how did it taste ?
- I don' t know .
I hate chocolate .
Well , it' s a good thing you' re going to a chocolate factory , you ungrateful little --
That question is , who will be the winner of the last gold -- ?
- Dad ?
- Yes , Charlie ?
Why aren' t you at work ?
Oh , well , the toothpaste factory thought they' d give me a bit of time off .
Like summer vacation ?
Sure .
Something like that .
In fact , it wasn' t like a vacation at all .
The upswing in candy sales had led to a rise in cavities ... ... which led to a rise in toothpaste sales .
With the extra money , the factory had decided to modernize ... ... eliminating Mr. Bucket' s job .
We were barely making ends meet as it was .
You' il find another job .
Until then , I' il just -- Well , I' il just thin down the soup a little more .
Don' t worry , Mr. Bucket , our luck will change .
I know it .
Charlie .
My secret hoard .
You and I are going to have one more fling ... ... at finding that last ticket .
You sure you want to spend your money on that ?
Of course I' m sure .
Here .
Run down to the nearest store ... ... and buy the first Wonka candy bar you see .
Bring it straight back , and we' il open it together .
Such a good boy , really .
Such a good ....
Grandpa ?
- You fell asleep .
- Have you got it ?
Which end should we open first ?
Just do it quick , like a Band- Aid .
Did you see that some kid in Russia found the last golden ticket ?
Yes , it was in the paper this morning .
Good boy .
Come on , George .
Good boy .
One Wonka Whipple- Scrumptious Fudgemallow Delight , please .
Okay .
Here you go .
The nerve of some people .
I know .
Forging a ticket .
Come on .
It' s a golden ticket .
You found Wonka' s last golden ticket .
ln my shop too !
Listen .
I' il buy it from you .
I' il give you $50 and a new bicycle .
Are you crazy ?
I' d give him $500 for that ticket .
You wanna sell me your ticket for $500 , young man ?
That' s enough of that .
Leave the kid alone .
Listen .
Don' t let anyone have it .
Take it straight home , you understand ?
Thank you .
Mom !
Dad !
I found it !
The last golden ticket !
It' s mine !
Here .
Read it aloud .
Let' s hear exactly what it says .
" Greetings to you , the lucky finder of this golden ticket , from Mr. Willy Wonka .
I shake you warmly by the hand .
For now , I do invite you to come to my factory ... ... and be my guest for one whole day . "
" I , Willy Wonka , will conduct you around the factory myself ... ... showing you everything there is to see . "
" Afterwards , when it is time to leave ... ... you will be escorted home by a procession of large trucks ... ... each one filled with all the chocolate you could ever eat . "
" And remember , one of you lucky five children will receive an extra prize ... ... beyond your wildest imagination .
Now , here are your instructions . "
" On the 1 st of February , you must come to the factory gates at 1 0 a . m . sharp .
You' re allowed to bring one member of your family to look after you .
Until then , Willy Wonka . "
The 1 st of February .
- But that' s tomorrow .
- Then there' s not a moment to lose .
Wash your face , comb your hair , scrub your hands , brush your teeth , blow your nose .
- And get that mud off your pants .
- Now we must all try and keep very calm .
First thing that we have to decide is this :
Who is going with Charlie to the factory ?
I will .
I' il take him .
You leave it to me .
How about you , dear ?
Don' t you think you ought to go ?
Well , Grandpa Joe seems to know more about it than we do , and ....
Provided , of course , he feels well enough .
No .
We' re not going .
A woman offered me $500 for the ticket .
I bet someone else would pay more .
We need the money more than we need the chocolate .
Young man , come here .
There' s plenty of money out there .
They print more every day .
But this ticket ... ... there' s only five of them in the whole world ... ... and that' s all there' s ever going to be .
Only a dummy would give this up for something as common as money .
Are you a dummy ?
No , sir .
Then get that mud off your pants .
You' ve got a factory to go to .
Daddy , I want to go in .
It' s 9 : 59 , sweetheart .
Make time go faster .
Do you think Mr. Wonka will recognize you ?
Hard to say .
It' s been years .
Eyes on the prize , Violet .
Eyes on the prize .
Please enter .
Come forward .
Close the gates .
Dear visitors ... ... it is my great pleasure to welcome you to my humble factory .
And who am I ?
Well ....
Willy Wonka , Willy Wonka
The amazing chocolatier
Willy Wonka , Willy Wonka
Everybody give a cheer !
Hooray !
He' s modest , clever and so smart
He barely can restrain it
With so much generosity
There is no way to contain it !
To contain it To contain , to contain , to contain !
Hooray !
Willy Wonka , Willy Wonka
He' s the one that you' re about to meet
Willy Wonka , Willy Wonka
He' s the genius who just can' t be beat
The magician and the chocolate wiz
The best darn guy who ever lived
Willy Wonka , here he is !
The amazing chocolatier
Wasn' t that just magnificent ?
I was worried it was getting a little dodgy in the middle part , but then that finale ....
Who are you ?
- He' s Willy Wonka .
- Really ?
" Good morning , starshine .
The Earth says hello . "
" Dear guests , greetings .
Welcome to the factory .
I shake you warmly by the hand .
My name is Willy Wonka . "
Then shouldn' t you be up there ?
I couldn' t very well watch the show from up there , now , could I , little girl ?
Mr. Wonka , I don' t know if you' il remember me ... ... but I used to work here in the factory .
Were you one of those despicable spies who tried to steal ... ... my life' s work and sell it to parasitic , copycat , candy- making cads ?
No , sir .
Then wonderful .
Welcome back .
Let' s get a move on , kids .
Don' t you want to know our names ?
Can' t imagine how it would matter .
Come quickly .
Far too much to see .
Just drop your coats anywhere .
- Mr. Wonka ?
Sure is toasty in here .
- What ?
I have to keep it warm in here .
My workers are used to an extremely hot climate .
They just can' t stand the cold .
Who are the workers ?
All in good time .
Now ....
Mr. Wonka , I' m Violet Beauregarde .
- I don' t care .
- Well , you should care .
Because I' m gonna win the special prize at the end .
Well , you do seem confident , and confidence is key .
I' m Veruca Salt .
It' s very nice to meet you , sir .
I always thought a verruca was a type of wart ... ... you got on the bottom of your foot .
I am Augustus Gloop .
I love your chocolate .
I can see that .
So do l .
I never expected to have so much in common .
You .
You' re Mike Teavee .
You' re the little devil who cracked the system .
And you .
Well , you' re just lucky to be here , aren' t you ?
And the rest of you must be their --
- Parents .
- Yeah .
Moms and dads .
Dad ?
Papa ?
Okay , then .
Let' s move along .
- Would you like some chocolate ?
- Sure .
Then you should' ve brought some .
- Let' s be friends .
- Best friends .
An important room , this .
- After all , it is a chocolate factory .
- Then why is the door so small ?
That' s to keep all the great big chocolatey flavor inside .
Now , do be careful , my dear children .
Don' t lose your heads .
Don' t get overexcited .
Just keep very calm .
It' s beautiful .
What ?
Oh , yeah , it' s very beautiful .
Every drop of the river ... ... is hot , melted chocolate of the finest quality .
The waterfall is most important .
Mixes the chocolate .
Churns it up .
Makes it light and frothy .
By the way ... ... no other factory in the world mixes its chocolate by waterfall , my dear children .
And you can take that to the bank .
People .
Those pipes ... ... suck up the chocolate and carry it away all over the factory .
Thousands of gallons an hour .
Yeah .
And do you like my meadow ?
Try some of my grass .
Please have a blade .
Please do .
It' s so delectable and so darn good- looking .
You can eat the grass ?
Of course you can .
Everything in this room is eatable .
Even I' m eatable .
But that is called cannibalism , my dear children ... ... and is , in fact , frowned upon in most societies .
Yeah .
Enjoy .
Go on .
Scoot , scoot .
Son .
Please .
Dad , he said , " Enjoy . "
Why hold on to it ?
Why not start a new piece ?
Because then I wouldn' t be a champion .
I' d be a loser , like you .
Daddy , look over there .
What is it ?
It' s a little person .
Over there , by the waterfall .
- There' s two of them .
- There' s more than two .
- Where do they come from ?
- Who are they ?
Are they real people ?
Of course they' re real people .
They' re Oompa- Loompas .
- Oompa- Loompas ?
- lmported , direct from Loompaland .
- There' s no such place .
- What ?
Mr. Wonka , I teach high- school geography , and I' m here to tell you --
Well , then you' il know all about it , and , oh , what a terrible country it is .
The whole place is nothing but thick jungles ... ... infested by the most dangerous beasts in the entire world .
Hornswogglers and snozzwangers and those terrible , wicked whangdoodles .
I went to Loompaland looking for exotic new flavors for candy .
Instead ... ... I found the Oompa- Loompas .
They lived in tree houses to escape from the fierce creatures who lived below .
The Oompa- Loompas ate nothing but green caterpillars , which tasted revolting .
The Oompa- Loompas looked for other things ... ... to mash up with the caterpillars to make them taste better :
Red beetles , the bark of the bong- bong tree .
All of them beastly ... ... but not quite so beastly as the caterpillars .
But the food they longed for the most was the cocoa bean .
An Oompa- Loompa was lucky if he found three or four cocoa beans a year .
But , oh , how they craved them .
All they' d ever think about was cocoa beans .
The cocoa bean is the thing from which chocolate is made , so I told the chief :
They are such wonderful workers .
I feel I must warn you , though , they are rather mischievous .
Always making jokes .
Augustus , my child , that is not a good thing you do !
Hey , little boy .
My chocolate must be untouched by human hands .
He' il drown .
He can' t swim .
Save him !
Augustus !
No !
Augustus !
Augustus , watch out !
There he goes .
Call the fire brigade !
It' s a wonder how that pipe is big enough .
It isn' t big enough .
He' s slowing down .
He' s gonna stick .
I think he has .
He' s blocked the whole pipe .
Look .
The Oompa- Loompas .
What are they doing ?
They' re going to treat us to a little song .
It is quite a special occasion .
They haven' t had a fresh audience in many a moon .
Augustus Gloop , Augustus Gloop
The great big , greedy nincompoop
Augustus Gloop , so big and vile So greedy , foul and infantile
" Come on ! " we cried " The time is ripe
To send him shooting up the pipe ! "
But don' t , dear children , be alarmed
Augustus Gloop will not be harmed
Augustus Gloop will not be harmed
Although , of course , we must admit
He will be altered quite a bit
Slowly , wheels go round and round
And cogs begin to grind and pound
This greedy brute , this louse' s ear
Is loved by people everywhere
For who could hate or bear a grudge
Against a luscious bit of fudge ?
Bravo !
Well done !
Aren' t they delightful ?
Aren' t they charming ?
- I do say , that all seemed rather rehearsed .
- Like they knew it was gonna happen .
Oh , poppycock .
Where is my son ?
Where does that pipe go to ?
That pipe , it just so happens to lead ... ... directly to the room where I make delicious ... ... strawberry- flavored , chocolate- coated fudge .
Then he will be made into strawberry- flavored , chocolate- coated fudge .
They' il be selling him by the pound all over the world ?
No .
I wouldn' t allow it .
The taste would be terrible .
Can you imagine Augustus- flavored , chocolate- coated Gloop ?
No one would buy it .
I want you to take Mrs. Gloop up to the Fudge Room , okay ?
Help her find her son .
Take a long stick and start poking around in the big chocolate- mixing barrel , okay ?
Mr. Wonka ?
Why would Augustus ' name already be in the Oompa- Loompa song , unless -- ?
lmprovisation is a parlor trick .
Anyone can do it .
You , little girl .
Say something .
- Anything .
- Chewing gum .
Chewing gum is really gross Chewing gum , I hate the most
See ?
Exactly the same .
No , it isn' t .
You really shouldn' t mumble .
Because I can' t understand a word you' re saying .
Now , on with the tour .
- Are the Oompa- Loompas really joking ?
- Of course they' re joking .
That boy will be fine .
What' s so funny ?
I think it' s from all those doggone cocoa beans .
Hey , by the way , did you guys know that chocolate contains a property ... ... that triggers the release of endorphins ?
Gives one the feeling of being in love .
You don' t say .
All aboard .
Onward !
Here .
Try some of this .
It' il do you good .
You look starved to death .
- It' s great .
- That' s because it' s mixed by waterfall .
The waterfall is most important .
Mixes the chocolate , churns it up , makes it light and frothy .
- By the way , no other factory in the world -- - You already said that .
- You' re all quite short , aren' t you ?
- Well , yeah .
We' re children .
Well , that' s no excuse .
I was never as short as you .
- You were once .
- Was not .
Know why ?
Because I distinctly remember putting a hat on top of my head .
Look at your short , little arms .
You could never reach .
Do you even remember what it was like being a kid ?
Oh , boy , do l .
Do l ?
In fact , Willy Wonka hadn' t thought about his childhood for years .
Trick or treat !
Trick or treat !
Trick or treat !
