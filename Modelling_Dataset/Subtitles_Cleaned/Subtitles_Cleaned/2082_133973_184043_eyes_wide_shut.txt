Okay , Roz , we ' re going now .
You look amazing , Mrs. Harford .
Thank you .
Helena , are you ready for bed ?
Yes , Mommy .
Can I stay up and watch The NUtcracker ?

The phone number is on the fridge . . . . . . and there' s food in there , so help yourself .
We shouldn' t be later than 1 : 00 .

- Thanks so much for coming .
- We wouldn' t miss it for the world .
Alice , look at you .
God , you ' re absolutely stunning !
I don' t say that to all the women .
Do l ?
- Yes , he does .
- He does ?
That osteopath you sent me to , the guy that worked on my arm ?
- You ought to see my serve now .
- He' s the top man in New York .
I could have told you that , looking at his bill .
Go inside , have a drink , enjoy the party .
I' il see you in a little bit .
Thanks for coming .
Do you know anyone here ?
Not a soul .
Why do you think Ziegler invites us to these things every year ?
This is what you get for making house calls .
You see that guy at the piano ?
I went to medical school with him .
Really ?
He plays pretty good for a doctor .
He' s not a doctor .
He dropped out .
Ladies and gentlemen , I hope you ' re enjoying yourselves .
The band' s going to take a break .
We' il be back in 1 0 minutes .
Thank you .
Let' s go over and say hello .
I desperately need to go to the bathroom .
You go and say hello , and I' il meet you where ?
At the bar ?
Good .
Nightingale .
Nick Nightingale !
Oh , my God !
Bill .
Bill Harford !
How the hell are you , buddy ?
- How long has it been ?
- I don' t know .
1 0 years ?
And a couple .
- Do you have time for a drink ?
- Sure .
You haven' t changed a bit .
Thanks , I think .
So how you doing ?
Not too bad , you know .
Not too bad .
I see you' ve become a pianist .
Oh , yes , well , my friends call me that .
How about you ?
You still in the doctor business ?
You know what they say :
" Once a doctor , always a doctor . "
Yes , or in my case :
" Never a doctor , never a doctor . "
I never did understand why you walked away .
It' s a nice feeling .
I do it a lot .
Cheers .
Excuse me .
Nick , I need you a minute .
Be right with you .
I gotta go do something .
lf I don' t catch you later . . . . . . l' il be down at the Village for two weeks at the Sonata Café .
- Stop by if you get a chance .
- I' il be there .
- It' s great seeing you .
- Good seeing you too , man .
I think that' s my glass .
l ' m absolutely certain of it .
My name is Sandor Szavost .
l ' m Hungarian .
My name is Alice Harford .
l ' m American .
Delighted to meet you , Alice .
Did you ever read the Latin poet Ovid on The Art of Love ?
Didn' t he wind up all by himself . . . . . . crying his eyes out . . . . . . in some place with a very bad climate ?
But he also had a good time first .
A very good time .
Are you here with anyone tonight , Alice ?
With my husband .
Oh , how sad .
But then l ' m sure he' s the sort of man who wouldn' t mind if we danced .
What do you do , Alice ?
Well , at the moment . . . . . . l ' m looking for a job .
I used to manage an art gallery in SoHo .
But it went broke .
What a shame .
I have some friends in the art game .
Perhaps I can be of some help .
Thank you .
Someone you know ?
My . . . . . . husband .
Don' t you think one of the charms of marriage . . . . . . is that it makes deception a necessity for both parties ?
May I ask why a beautiful woman . . . . . . who could have any man in this room , wants to be married ?
Why wouldn' t she ?
ls it as bad as that ?
As good as that .
Do you know Nuala Windsor ?
No , and it' s very lovely to meet you both .
How do you spell Nuala ?
N- U- A- L- A.
You don' t remember me , do you ?
You were very kind to me once .
Only once ?
That sounds like a terrible oversight !
I was doing a photo session in Rockefeller Plaza . . . . . . on a very windy day . . . ?
- And you got something in your eye .
- Just about half of Fifth Avenue .
You were such a gentleman !
You gave me your handkerchief . . . . . . which was also clean .
That is the kind of hero I can be sometimes .
You know why women used to get married , don' t you ?
Why don' t you tell me ?
It was the only way they could lose their virginity . . . . . . and be free to do what they wanted with other men .
The ones they really wanted .
Fascinating .
Do you know what' s so nice about doctors ?
Usually a lot less than people imagine .
They always seem so . . . . . . knowledgeable .
Oh , they are very knowledgeable . . . . . . about all sorts of things .
But I bet they work too hard .
Just think of all they miss .
You ' re probably right .
Ladies , where exactly are we going ?
Exactly ?
Where the rainbow ends .
Where the rainbow ends ?
Don' t you want to go where the rainbow ends ?
Now that depends where that is .
Well , let' s find out .
Excuse me , ladies .
Sorry , Dr. Harford .
Could you come with me for a moment ?
Something for Mr. Ziegler .
Fine .
To be continued ?
Bill , thanks for coming .
We had a little accident here .
What happened ?
Well , she was . . . .
She was shooting up and she had a bad reaction .
What did she take ?
A speedball or a snowball or whatever the hell they call it .
It' s heroin and coke .
Heroin and coke ?
Anything else ?
We had a couple of drinks , some champagne .
That was it .
How long has she been like this ?
Maybe five minutes , six minutes , something like that .
What' s her name ?
Mandy .
Can you hear me , Mandy ?
Can you hear me ?
Move your head if you can hear me .
Move your head if you can hear me , Mandy .
There you go .
You can hear me .
Can you open your eyes for me ?
Mandy , can you do that ?
Let me see you open your eyes .
There you go , come on .
Come on , look at me .
Look at me .
Look at me .
Look at me .
Look at me .
Look at me , Mandy .
Good .
Good .
I love Victor' s art collection , don' t you ?
It' s wonderful .
Have you ever seen his sculpture gallery ?
I haven' t .
He has a wonderful collection of Renaissance bronzes .
Do you like the period ?
I do .
I adore it .
The sculpture gallery is upstairs .
Would you like to see it ?
I can show it to you .
We won' t be gone long .
Maybe . . .
. . . not just . . .
. . . now .
That was really one hell of a scare you gave us , kiddo .
Sorry .
How are you feeling now , Mandy ?
Better .
You are a very , very lucky girl .
You know that ?
I know .
You ' re gonna be okay this time .
But you can' t keep doing this .
You understand ?
You ' re going to need some rehab .
You know that , don' t you ?
I know .
Well , Victor . . .
. . . l' il leave the rest to you .
ls it okay if I dress her and get her out of here ?
No , I' d keep her here for another hour .
Another hour ?
Then I' d have someone take her home .
Good night , Mandy .
I can' t thank you enough for this .
- You saved my ass .
- l ' m glad I was here .
Bill , I probably . . . .
I know I don' t have to mention this . . . . . . but this is just between us .
Of course .
Thanks .
I think I' ve had a little too much champagne .
I think I have to go and find my husband now .
But l ' m sure he' il be all right on his own a little longer .
Yes . . .
. . . but will l ?
Of course you will .
I really have to go .
I have to go .
You don' t , you know .
Yes , I do .
I must see you again .
- That' s impossible .
- Why ?
Because . . .
. . . l ' m married .
Good morning , Lisa .
Good morning , doctor .
Your mail .
Good .
Please ask Janelle to bring me my coffee .
- Sure .
- Thank you .
- Good morning , Sarah .
- Good morning , doctor . " ' Twas the night before Christmas , when all throUgh the hoUse ... ... not a creatUre was stirring , not even a moUse . "
Okay .
That' s fine .
You can put your gown on .
Hold this for Mommy .
Looking forward to Christmas ?
Does this hurt ?
Right there ?
Daddy' s gonna like that .
Very good choice . " -- before me . . . . . . when I jump into my bed . "
We should call the Zieglers and thank them for the party .
I' ve taken care of that .
Good .
So how do you feel about wrapping the rest of the presents ?
Let' s do that tomorrow .
Tell me something .
Those two girls . . .
. . . at the party last night . . . .
Did you . . . . . . by any chance . . . . . . happen to . . .
. . . fuck them ?
What ?
What are you talking about ?
l ' m talking about the two girls . . . . . . that you were so blatantly hitting on .
I wasn' t hitting on anybody .
Who were they ?
They were just a couple of models .
And where did you disappear to with them for so long ?
Wait a minute .
I didn' t disappear with anybody .
Ziegler wasn' t feeling too well . . . . . . and I got called upstairs to see him .
Anyway , who was the guy you were dancing with ?
A friend of the Zieglers .
What did he want ?
What did he want ?
Sex . . .
. . . upstairs .
Then and there .
ls that all ?
Yeah , that was all .
Just wanted to fuck my wife .
That' s right .
Well , I guess that' s understandable .
Understandable ?
Because you are a very . . . . . . very beautiful woman .
Wait .
Because l ' m a beautiful woman . . . . . . the only reason any man ever wants to talk to me . . .
. . . is because he wants to fuck me .
ls that what you ' re saying ?
Well , I don' t think it' s quite that black and white . . .
. . . but I think we both know what men are like .
So on that basis . . . . . . l should conclude that you wanted to fuck those two models .
There are exceptions .
And what makes you an exception ?
What makes me an exception is that . . .
. . . l happen to be in love with you .
And because we ' re married . . . . . . and because I would never lie to you . . . . . . or hurt you .
Do you realize that what you ' re saying . . . . . . is that the only reason you wouldn' t fuck those models . . . . . . is out of consideration for me ?
Not because you really wouldn' t want to .
Let' s just relax , Alice .
This pot is making you aggressive .
No !
It' s not the pot .
It' s you !
Why can' t you ever give me a straight fucking answer ?
I was under the impression that' s what I was doing .
I don' t even know what we ' re arguing about here .
l ' m not arguing .
l ' m just trying to find out where you ' re coming from .
Where l ' m coming from ?
Let' s say , for example , you have some gorgeous woman . . . . . . standing in your office naked . . . . . . and you ' re feeling her fucking tits .
Now , what I want to know . . . .
I want to know what you ' re thinking about when you ' re squeezing them .
Alice , I happen to be a doctor .
It' s all very impersonal . . . . . . and you know there' s always a nurse present .
So when you ' re feeling tits , it' s nothing more than your professionalism ?
Exactly .
Sex is the last thing on my mind when l ' m with a patient .
Now , when she is having her little titties squeezed . . . . . . do you think she ever has fantasies . . . . . . about what handsome Dr. Bill' s dickie might be like ?
Come on , I can assure you sex is the last thing . . . . . . on this fucking hypothetical woman patient' s mind .
And what makes you so sure ?
lf for no better reason . . . . . . because she' s afraid of what I might find .
So after you tell her that everything' s fine , what then ?
What then ?
I don' t know , Alice . . . .
What then ?
Women don' t . . . .
They basically just don' t think like that .
Millions of years of evolution , right ?
Men have to stick it every place they can . . . . . . but for women , it is just about security and commitment . . . . . . and whatever the fuck else !
A little oversimplified , Alice .
But yes , something like that .
lf you men only knew .
What I do know is you got stoned , you tried to pick a fight . . . . . . and now you ' re trying to make me jealous .
But you ' re not the jealous type , are you ?
No , l ' m not .
You' ve never been jealous about me , have you ?
No , I haven' t .
And why haven' t you ever been jealous about me ?
Well , I don' t know , Alice .
Maybe because you ' re my wife .
Maybe because you ' re the mother of my child . . . . . . and I know you would never be unfaithful to me .
You are very , very sure of yourself . . . . . . aren' t you ?
No .
l ' m sure of you .
Do you think that' s funny ?
All right .
Fuck it .
Now we get the fucking laughing fit , right ?
Do you . . . .
Do you remember last summer at Cape Cod ?
Do you remember one night in the dining room . . . . . . there was this young naval officer . . . . . . and he was sitting near our table with two other officers ?
No .
The waiter brought him a message , at which point he left .
Nothing rings a bell ?
Well . . .
. . . l first saw him that morning in the lobby .
He was checking into the hotel . . . . . . and he was following the bellboy with his luggage . . . . . . to the elevator .
He glanced at me as he walked past .
Just a glance .
Nothing more .
But I could hardly . . .
. . . move .
That afternoon . . .
. . . Helena went to the movies with her friend . . .
. . . and you and I made love .
And we made plans about our future . . .
. . . and we talked about Helena .
And yet . . .
. . . at no time . . .
. . . was he ever . . .
. . . out of my mind .
And I thought if he wanted me . . .
. . . even if it was only . . .
. . . for one night . . .
. . . l was ready to give up everything .
You .
Helena .
My whole fucking future .
Everything .
And yet it was weird , because at the same time . . .
. . . you were dearer to me than ever .
And at that moment , my love for you . . .
. . . was both . . .
. . . tender and sad .
I barely slept that night . . .
. . . and I woke up the next morning in a panic .
I didn' t know whether I was afraid that he had left . . .
. . . or that he might still be there .
But by dinner . . .
. . . l realized he was gone . . .
. . . and I was . . . . . . relieved .
Yes , this is Dr. Harford .
When did it happen ?
I have the address .
Thank you .
Lou Nathanson just died .
I think I have to go over there and show my face .
- Hello , Rosa .
- Good evening , Dr. Harford .
- How is Miss Nathanson ?
- Not so good .
She' s in the bedroom .
Thank you .
Come in .
Marion . . . .
Oh , Dr. Harford . . . .
How good of you to come .
I came as soon as I got the message .
Thank you .
- l ' m so sorry .
- Thank you .
Your father was . . . .
He was a very brave man .
Oh , thank you .
How are you holding up ?
l ' m a bit numb .
I don' t think it' s really sunk in yet .
Would you like to sit down ?
It' s so unreal .
Daddy had such a good day .
His mind was clear , and he remembered so many things .
Then he had a little dinner . . . . . . and he said he felt like taking a nap .
I went into the kitchen and talked to Rosa for half an hour at most . . .
. . . and when I went to see how he was . . . . . . l just thought he was asleep .
Then I realized he wasn' t breathing .
From what you' ve said . . . . . . l ' m sure your father died peacefully in his sleep .
Oh , God , I hope so .
I think I' ve been more afraid of the way it was going to happen . . . . . . than his death itself .
Have you had a chance to phone any of your relatives ?
I tried to call my stepmother in London , but she was out .
My boyfriend , Carl , is making some calls . . . . . . and he' il be coming over soon .
I think you' ve met Carl here a few times .
Yes , I remember him .
He' s a teacher , isn' t he ?
A math professor .
We ' re going to get married in May .
Well , that' s wonderful news .
Congratulations .
Thank you .
Carl has a new teaching appointment at the University of Michigan .
We' il be moving out there soon .
Michigan' s a beautiful state .
I think you' il like it a lot .
It really could be a wonderful change for you , Marion .
Oh , my God , no . . . .
I love you .
I love you .
I love you , I love you , I love you .
I don' t want to go away with Carl .
Marion , I don' t think you realize --
I do .
Even if l ' m never to see you again , I want at least to live near you .
Marion , listen to me .
Listen to me .
You ' re very upset , and I don' t think you realize what you ' re saying .
I love you .
We barely know each other .
We haven' t had a single conversation about anything except your father .
I love you .
That' s probably Carl .
Please don' t despise me .
- Hello , Rosa .
- Hello , Mr. Thomas .
- ls she in the bedroom ?
- Yes , she is .
Thank you .
Come in .
Darling .
l ' m so very sorry .
Are you all right ?
l ' m okay .
- Dr. Harford , good evening .
- Good evening , Carl .
Thank you very much for coming over here tonight .
- It' s the least I could do .
- It means a lot to us .
Thank you .
I was actually on my way out .
Marion . . .
. . . your father was very proud of you . . . . . . and I know you gave him great comfort these last months .
Thank you .
I' il show you out .
Good night .
Listen to this .
She had a red rose in her mouth .
She was doing a Mexican lap dance right in my face .
l ' m serious !
I got scars on the back of my neck .
What team' s this switch hitter playing for ?
- Looks like the pink team .
- Look at this faggot !
Hey , watch it , you faggot !
Merry Christmas , Mary !
- Your butt- brothers are back there !
- Prime cut of meat !
You want to take a ride in this fudge- tunnel , you stupid faggot ?
You should have tits , you ' re standing so close !
- I got dumps that are bigger than you !
- Come on , macho man !
- You want a piece of this , baby ?
- Exit only , honey .
Go back to San Francisco where you belong , man !
Excuse me .
Do you know what time it is ?
Ten past 1 2 .
Going anywhere special ?
No , l ' m just taking a walk .
How' d you like to have a little fun ?
l ' m sorry ?
Have a little fun ?
I just live right down there .
Would you like to come inside with me ?
Come inside with you ?
It' s a lot nicer in there than it is out here .
You live in there ?
By yourself ?
No .
I have a roommate , but she' s not home .
Hey , it' s okay .
Listen , no one will bother us .
It' s okay .
Come on .
Come on .
This is it .
That' s a nice tree .
Sorry about the mess .
Maid' s day off .
It' s . . .
. . . cozy .
It' s a . . . . . . cozy place .
It' s okay .
Do you suppose we should talk about money ?
Yeah , I guess so .
That depends on what you want to do .
What do you want to do ?
What do you recommend ?
What do I recommend ?
I' d rather not put it into words .
How about you just leave it up to me ?
l ' m in your hands .
And how does 1 50 sound ?
Sounds wonderful .
Don' t worry .
I don' t keep track of the time .
Thank yoU .
Prego , prego .
- Grazie .
- YoU' re welcome .
If I was Italian , he' d have answered me in Italian .
Shall we ?
Excuse me .
ls everything all right ?
I was just wondering if you were going to be much longer ?
Listen , it' s a little difficult to talk right now .
It could be awhile .
Any idea how long ?
No , I don' t really know .
We ' re still waiting for some relatives to arrive .
Well , l ' m gonna go to bed now .
Was that Mrs. Dr. Bill ?
Do you have to go ?
Do I have to go ?
I think I do .
Are you sure ?
Yes , l ' m afraid so .
But listen , I want to pay you anyway .
How much did you say it was ?
Hundred and fifty ?
But you know what ?
You don' t have to bother about that .
No , it' s all right .
- No , really .
You don' t have to .
- No , I want to .
Really ?
Well , thank you very much .
Thank you .
Would you like a table , or would you like to sit at the bar ?
- I' d like a table .
- Please follow me .
- Can I take your coat ?
- Thank you .
Could I get you anything to drink ?
- I' d like a beer .
- Certainly .
One , two , one- two- three- four .
That' s it for tonight , ladies and gentlemen .
On the bass , Mr. Larry McVey .
On the drums , Kip Fleming .
And on the guitar , the one , the only , Mr. Bobby Berman .
We' il be here for the next two weeks , so please do stop by .
l ' m Nick Nightingale .
Good night .
- Nick , that was great .
- Thanks .
- Nightingale .
- Hey , Bill , you made it .
l ' m sorry , I got here just as you were finishing your last set .
That' s all right .
The band sucked tonight anyway .
- What are you drinking ?
- A vodka and tonic , please .
Thank you .
So what brings you out at this hour ?
- I have a patient in the neighborhood .
- You live in the Village ?
No , we have an apartment on Central Park West .
You ' re married ?
Nine years .
- Any kids ?
- Yes , we have a 7- year- old daughter .
How about you ?
I' ve got a wife and four boys in Seattle .
You ' re a long way from home .
Well , you gotta go where the work is .
Thank you .
- ls this your band ?
- No , it' s a pick- up band .
- Who do you normally play with ?
- Anybody , anywhere .
I got another gig later tonight .
You ' re playing somewhere else tonight ?
They only get started around 2 .
ln the Village ?
Believe it or not , I don' t actually know the address yet .
You don' t ?
No .
It may sound ridiculous , but it' s in a different place every time . . . . . . and I only get it an hour or so before .
- A different place every time ?
- So far .
What' s the big mystery ?
Hey , man , I just play the piano .
Nick , l ' m sorry .
ls there something l ' m missing here ?
I play blindfolded .
What ?
I play blindfolded .
You ' re putting me on .
No , it' s the truth .
And the last time , the blindfold wasn' t on so well .
Oh , man .
Bill , I have seen one or two things in my life . . . . . . but never . . . . . . never anything like this . . . . . . and never such women .
Excuse me .
Yes , sir .
Yes , sir , this is Nick .
I know where that is .
Right .
Well , l ' m on my way right now .
Okay , sir .
Thank you .
What is this ?
It' s the name of a Beethoven opera , isn' t it ?
It' s the password .
The password ?
Yeah .
Look , l ' m really sorry to do this to you , Bill .
I gotta get going .
I gotta go .
You know there is no way on earth . . . . . . that you are going to leave here without taking me with you .
- Come on , buddy , give me a break .
- Nick , I' il tell you what .
I' ve already got the password .
Just give me the address .
I' il go there by myself . . . . . . and there won' t be any connection between us whatsoever .
Listen , let' s just say for one second . . . . . . that I was prepared to do that .
You couldn' t get in anyway in those clothes .
Why not ?
Because everyone is always costumed and masked .
Where the hell are you gonna get a costume at this hour ?
Thanks .
Keep the change .
Yes ?
Who is it ?
Peter , this is Bill Harford .
I apologize for disturbing you at this hour , but I need your help .
Who is it that yoU want ?
l ' m very sorry .
l ' m looking for Peter Grenning . . . . . . the owner of Rainbow Fashions .
What' s yoUr name ?
My name is Bill Harford .
l ' m Mr. Grenning' s doctor .
YoU are Grenning' s doctor ?
Okay .
JUst a moment .
You are looking for Peter Grenning ?
Yes , I am .
He moved to Chicago over a year ago .
He moved to Chicago ?
I wasn' t aware of that .
Then are you the present owner of Rainbow Fashions ?
Yes , I am .
Well , first of all . . . . . . please let me apologize again for disturbing you at this hour , Mr. . . .
Milich .
Mr. Milich .
Just to let you know that I really am Dr. Harford . . . . . . this is my New York State Medical Board card .
Okay , so you are Dr. Harford .
lf I see Peter , I tell him you were looking for him .
Oh , no , wait .
Please , please . . . .
Listen , the reason that I came here tonight was . . . .
Basically , the reason is that I need a costume .
And I' d be happy to pay you $ 1 00 over the rental price . . . . . . for the inconvenience .
A hundred dollars ?
I don' t think so .
How about $200 ?
Two hundred dollars over the rental price ?
Come in .
Can' t be too careful these days .
Please .
ls it any special costume you are looking for ?
I need a tux , a cloak with a hood and a mask .
A cloak with a hood and a mask ?
I think we' il find something for you .
Follow me , please .
Good .
Looks like alive , huh ?
- It' s wonderful .
- Come .
So what color cloak ?
Red , brown , red ?
Black .
The good doctor wouldn' t like something more colorful ?
- I don' t think so .
- Clowns , officers , pirates ?
No , just the tux , the black cloak --
With a hood and a mask .
May I take your coat ?
- You are medicine doctor , yes ?
- Yes , I am .
- I have some problem with my hair .
- Your hair ?
It' s starting to fall down too fast .
I lost , in two weeks , a lot of hair .
Mostly here .
Look at this .
Here .
You see ?
And ?
l ' m afraid this really isn' t my field .
What ?
You can' t help me ?
No .
You should see a trichologist .
It' s a hair specialist .
Mr. Milich , I' ve obviously left things a bit late tonight .
So if you don' t mind --
l ' m in hurry too , to get back to bed .
I understand .
So black cloak ?
Did you hear something ?
What is this ?
What is it ?
What is this ?
What on earth is going on here ? !
Milich , I can explain everything .
You !
What are you doing here ?
I promise I' il kill you !
And you !
Have you no sense of decency ?
Gentlemen , have you no sense of decency ? !
Milich , are you crazy ?
We were invited here by the young lady .
Young lady ?
This is my daughter !
Couldn' t you see she' s a child ?
- You will have to explain to police !
- To the police ? !
You little whore !
I kill you for this .
I promise , I' il kill you !
I' il kill you !
Hold on to that girl for me , please !
Milich , this is preposterous .
The young lady invited us here .
Couldn' t you see she is deranged ? !
Doctor , l ' m sorry to keep you waiting .
Gentlemen , this is now a police matter .
You will please stay here until I return .
Let us out of here !
That' s out of the question .
Doctor , sorry .
What color did you say ?
- Black ?
- Black .
Gentlemen , please have the goodness to be quiet for the moment !
Couldn' t you see I try to serve my customer ?
Sorry .
And you , little whore , go to bed at once , you depraved creature .
I' il deal with you after I serve this gentleman .
You should have a cloak lined with ermine .
Okay , that' s $74 . 50 .
Seventy- four fifty .
All right .
There' s 80 .
I promised you 50 bucks over the meter , right ?
I' il make that a hundred , if you wait for me .
Just let the meter run .
I' il give you the other half plus the meter when I get back .
- Okay ?
- How long you gonna be ?
I don' t know , maybe an hour or more .
But maybe only 1 0 minutes .
I' il leave my stuff here in the back .
Good evening , sir .
Good evening .
Can we be of any help ?
I suppose you' d like the password .
lf you' d like , sir .
Fidelio .
Thank you , sir .
We' il run you up to the house .
Good evening , sir .
Good evening .
Password , sir ?
Fidelio .
Thank you , sir .
l ' m not sure what you think you ' re doing .
But you don' t belong here .
l ' m sorry , but I think you' ve mistaken me for someone else .
Please !
Don' t be foolish .
You must go now .
Who are you ?
It doesn' t matter who I am .
You are in great danger .
You must get away while there' s still a chance .
Would you be so good as to excuse us for a moment ?
Have you been enjoying yourself ?
Well , I' ve had a very interesting look around .
Do you want to go somewhere a little more private ?
Private ?
That might be a good idea .
Here you are .
I' ve been looking all over for you .
May I borrow him for just a few minutes ?
I promise to bring him right back .
I don' t think you realize the danger you ' re in now .
You can' t fool them for much longer .
You' ve got to get away before it' s too late .
Why are you telling me this ?
It doesn' t matter .
Who are you ?
You don' t want to know .
But you must go .
Now !
Will you come with me ?
That' s impossible .
Why ?
Because it would cost me my life and possibly yours .
Let me see your face .
Go !
Excuse me , sir .
Are you the gentleman with the taxi waiting for him ?
Yes .
Your driver' s at the front door and would urgently like a word with you .
Please , come forward .
May I have the password , please ?
Fidelio .
That' s right , sir .
That is the password . . . . . . for admittance .
But may I ask , what is the password for the house ?
The password for the house ?
l ' m sorry , l . . . .
I seem to have . . .
. . . forgotten it .
That' s unfortunate .
Because here , it doesn' t matter whether you have forgotten it . . . . . . or if you never knew it .
You will kindly remove your mask .
Now . . . . . . get undressed .
Get undressed ?
Remove your clothes .
Gentlemen , please . . . .
Remove your clothes .
Or would you like us to do it for you ?
Stop !
Let him go .
Take me !
I am ready to redeem him .
You are ready to redeem him ?
Yes .
Are you sure you understand what you ' re taking upon yourself . . . . . . in doing this ?
Very well .
You are free .
But I warn you . . . . . . if you make any further inquiries . . . . . . or if you say a single word to anyone . . . . . . about what you have seen . . . . . . there will be the most dire consequences for you . . . . . . and your family .
Do you understand ?
What is going to happen to that woman ?
No one can change her fate now .
When a promise has been made here . . . . . . there is no turning back .
Go !
It' s okay .
l ' m sorry .
l ' m sorry I woke you up , but I thought you were having a nightmare .
Oh , God .
I just had such a horrible dream .
What time is it ?
It' s a little after 4 .
Did you just get home ?
It took longer than I thought .
You must be exhausted .
Come on , lie down .
What were you dreaming ?
Just these weird things .
What was it ?
It was so weird .
Tell me .
We were in a deserted city . . .
. . . and our clothes were gone .
We were naked . . .
. . . and I was terrified . . .
. . . and I felt ashamed .
Oh , God . . . .
And I was angry because I thought it was your fault .
You rushed away to go find clothes for us .
As soon as you were gone , it was completely different .
I felt wonderful .
Then I was lying in a beautiful garden . . . . . . stretched out naked in the sunlight . . .
. . . and a man walked out of the woods .
He was the man from the hotel , the one I told you about .
The naval officer .
He stared at me . . .
. . . and then he just laughed .
He just laughed at me .
But that' s not the end . . .
. . . is it ?
Why don' t you tell me the rest of it ?
It' s too awful .
It' s only a dream .
He was kissing me . . .
. . . and then we were making love .
Then there were all these other people around us . . . . . . hundreds of them , everywhere .
Everyone was fucking .
And then l . . . .
I was fucking other men .
So many . . .
. . . l don' t know how many I was with .
And I knew you could see me in the arms of all these men . . .
. . . just fucking all these men .
I wanted to make fun of you . . .
. . . to laugh in your face .
And so I laughed as loud as I could .
That must have been when you woke me up .
Shit !
I' il just have a cup of coffee , please .
Anything else ?
No , thank you .
Excuse me .
Do you know when they get in next door at the Sonata Café ?
I think there' s usually someone in the office around 2 or 3 .
I don' t suppose , by any chance , you know Nick Nightingale ?
He' s playing piano over there right now .
Nick Nightingale ?
Sure , he comes in here .
Look , maybe you can help me . . . . . . because it' s important that I get in touch with him .
Do you know where he' s staying ?
I don' t know if he' d want me to give out his address .
It' s okay , l ' m a doctor .
l ' m actually an old friend of his .
Well , doctor . . .
. . . he' il be playing there tonight .
Can' t it wait until then ?
To be perfectly honest . . .
. . . it' s a medical matter .
Some tests .
I know he' il want to know about them as soon as possible .
Excuse me .
Hi !
How can I help you ?
Can you please ring Mr. Nightingale' s room for me ?
l ' m sorry , sir , Mr. Nightingale has already checked out .
He checked out ?
- Did he leave a forwarding address ?
- No , l ' m afraid not .
When did he check out ?
About 5 : 00 this morning .
5 : 00 ?
That' s an early checkout , isn' t it ?
It is a little on the early side , yeah .
Did you notice anything . . . . . . l don' t know . . . . . . unusual about him when he left ?
Unusual ?
Hey , you ' re not Five- O , are you ?
No , l ' m an old friend of his .
Really ?
l ' m a doctor .
- Well , Bill . . . ?
- Sure .
It' s funny you should ask that question , Bill . . . . . . because there was something a little strange . . . . . . about the way Mr. Nightingale left .
Really ?
What was that ?
He came in this morning , about 4 : 30 a . m . . . . . . with two men .
Big guys .
They were very well- dressed and very well- spoken .
But they weren' t the kind of people you' d fool around with . . . . . . if you know what I mean .
Anyways . . .
. . . l noticed Mr. Nightingale had a bruise on his cheek .
To be perfectly honest , I also thought he looked a little scared .
Scared ?
He said he wanted to check out .
And then he went upstairs to his room with one of the men .
The other guy stayed down in the lobby and settled his bill .
When they came back , Mr. Nightingale tried to pass me an envelope .
But they saw it and took it . . . . . . and said that any mail or messages for him . . . . . . would be collected by someone properly authorized to do so .
And then they just took him off in a car .
Do you have any idea where they went ?
No , not a clue .
I certainly appreciate your help .
Anytime , Bill .
Oh , the good doctor !
- Was your outfit a success ?
- Yes , it was .
Thank you .
Good , good .
Tuxedo .
Cloak .
Shoes .
I think you forgot the mask .
It' s not there ?
Maybe you left it at the party ?
I don' t think so .
I must have lost it .
Could you put it on the bill , please ?
Sure .
Here we are .
That was 1 50 for the rental , 200 you said for my trouble . . . . . . 25 for the mask .
Sorry . . . .
Three hundred seventy- five .
Yes , dear ?
Come , come .
Would you like to say hello to Dr. Harford ?
Thank you , Mr. Milich .
I' il call you soon .
Goodbye , gentlemen .
- Merry Christmas and happy New Year !
- And you too .
Well , Dr. Harford . . .
. . . here is your receipt .
l ' m tearing up your deposits . . .
. . . and thanks for the business .
Mr. Milich , last night . . .
. . . you were going to call the police .
Things change .
We have come to another arrangement .
And by the way , if the good doctor should ever want anything again . . . . . . anything at all . . . . . . it needn' t be a costume .
Come in .
- Tuna salad and black coffee .
- Thanks .
Listen , how' s my afternoon looking ?
I think it' s just Mrs. Akerly at 2 : 30 and Mrs. Kominski at 4 .
Well , something' s come up , and l ' m not going to be able to see them .
Please ask Dr. Miller if he can fit them in .
Otherwise , just apologize . . . - . . . and make new appointments .
- Sure .
And please call the garage and have them get my car out in half an hour .
No problem .
Any calls for me ?
Dr. Sanders and Mrs. Shapiro .
- Hey , gang .
- Hi , Daddy .
Look , I got all these right .
You got all of those right ?
Every single one of them ?
That' s good .
You hungry ?
Sort of .
Want to eat at 7 ?
Seven ?
Listen , can we make that earlier ?
I have some appointments at the office .
You have to go out again tonight ?
l ' m afraid so .
Daddy , am I gonna get a puppy for Christmas ?
We' il see about that , okay ?
He could be a watchdog . . . .
We' il see .
Come on , baby , let' s finish this off .
All right , we have Joe .
And Joe has $2 . 50 .
And Mike has $ 1 . 75 .
Joe has how much more money than Mike ? $0 . 75 ?
So is it gonna be a subtraction or an addition ?
" How much more " means that it would be a subtraction .
Yeah , because you ' re going to be taking .
Right .
And there were all these other people aroUnd Us .
HUndreds of them , everywhere .
Everyone was fUcking .
And then I ....
I was fUcking other men .
So many ... ... I don' t know how many I was with .
Keep the change .
Merry Christmas .
What is it ?
Domino ?
No , she' s not in .
Are you expecting her back soon ?
No , l ' m not .
I have something for her .
Can I leave this with you ?
Just a minute .
Can I say who it' s from ?
Well , just tell her it' s from . . . . . . Bill .
You ' re Bill ?
The Bill ?
You ' re the doctor who was here last night ?
Well , I suppose I am .
Domino said how nice you were to her .
Did she ?
Why don' t you come in for a second ?
Sure .
l ' m Sally .
Hello , Sally .
So do you have any idea when you expect Domino back ?
I have no idea .
You have no idea ?
To be perfectly honest , she may not even be coming back .
She may not even be coming back ?
l . . . .
You . . . ?
I think there' s something that I should tell you .
Really ?
But I just don' t know .
I don' t know .
You don' t know ?
Well , what is it ?
I don' t know whether to tell you this .
Why don' t you have a seat ?
Let' s sit down .
- I don' t quite know how to say this .
- You don' t quite know how ?
Well , considering that you were with Domino last night . . .
. . . l think it would be only fair to you to let you know . . .
. . . that she got the results of a blood test this morning . . . . . . and it was HlV- positive .
HlV- positive ?
I am very , very sorry to hear that .
I mean , it' s absolutely devastating .
Listen , can I offer you anything ?
A cup of coffee maybe ?
No , thank you .
I think . . .
. . . maybe I' d better be going .
- Taxi !
- Off duty .
I' il just have a cappuccino , please .
I' il bring it over to you .
Thank you .
- Good evening .
- Good evening .
l ' m Dr. Harford .
One of my patients was admitted this morning .
Miss Amanda Curran .
Could you please give me her room number ?
Certainly , doctor .
Her name again ?
Curran .
Amanda Curran .
C- U- R- R- A- N ?
Miss Amanda Curran ?
That' s right .
l ' m sorry , doctor .
Miss Curran died this afternoon .
She died this afternoon ?
Yes , at 3 : 45 p . m .
l ' m sorry .
BecaUse it coUld cost me my life ... ... and possibly yoUrs .
Yes , this is Dr. Harford .
Tonight ?
No , no , that' s okay .
Please tell him I' il be there in about 20 minutes .
Come in .
Bill , I appreciate you coming .
Sorry to drag you out here .
- Let me have your coat .
- I was out anyway .
Thank you .
How about a drink ?
- Are you having one ?
- Sure .
What would you like ?
Just a little scotch .
Good .
How do you take it ?
Neat ?
Please .
That was a terrific party the other night .
- Alice and I had a wonderful time .
- Well , good .
It was great seeing you both .
Cheers .
Were you playing ?
No , I was just knocking a few balls around .
- Beautiful scotch .
- That' s a 25- year- old .
- I' il send you over a case .
- No , please .
Why not ?
You feel like playing ?
No , thanks .
You go ahead , I' il watch .
I was just . . . .
Listen . . . .
The reason I asked you to come over is . . .
. . . l need to talk to you about something .
Sure .
It' s a little bit awkward .
And I have to be completely frank .
What kind of problem are you having ?
It isn' t a medical problem .
Actually . . .
. . . it concerns you .
I know what happened last night .
And I know what' s been going on since then .
And I think you just might . . .
. . . have the wrong idea about one or two things .
l ' m sorry , Victor , l . . . .
What in the hell are you talking about ?
Please , Bill , no games .
I was there .
At the house .
I saw everything that went on .
What the hell did you think you were doing ?
I couldn' t even begin to imagine . . .
. . . how you' d heard about it . . . . . . let alone got yourself through the door .
Then I remembered seeing you with that prick piano player . . . . . . Nick whatever the fuck his name was , at my party .
And it didn' t take much to figure out the rest .
It wasn' t Nick' s fault .
It was mine .
Of course it was Nick' s fault .
lf he hadn' t mentioned it to you , none of this would' ve happened .
I recommended that cocksucker to those people . . . . . . and he' s made me look like a complete asshole .
What can I say ?
I had . . .
. . . absolutely . . . . . . no idea you were involved in any way .
I know you didn' t , Bill .
But I also know that you . . . .
You went to Nick' s hotel this morning . . . . . . and talked to the desk clerk .
How do you know that ?
Because I had you followed .
You had me followed ?
Okay , okay , l ' m sorry .
All right ?
I owe you an apology .
This was for your own good , believe me .
I know what the desk clerk told you .
But what he didn' t tell you is . . . . . . all they did was put Nick on a plane to Seattle .
By now he' s probably back with his family . . . . . . banging Mrs. Nick .
The clerk said he had a bruise on his face .
Okay , he had a bruise on his face .
That' s a hell of a lot less than he deserves .
I don' t think you realize what kind of trouble you were in last night .
Who do you think those people were ?
Those were not just ordinary people there .
lf I told you their names -- l ' m not gonna tell you their names . . . . . . but if I did , I don' t think you' d sleep so well .
Was it the second password ?
ls that what gave me away ?
Yes , finally .
But not because you didn' t know it .
It' s because there was no second password .
Of course it didn' t help a whole lot that those people arrive in limos . . . . . . and you showed up in a taxi .
Or that they found the receipt from the rental house in your coat . . . . . . made out to you- know- who .
There was a woman there . . .
. . . who tried to warn me .
I know .
Do you know who she was ?
She was a hooker .
Sorry , but . . .
. . . that' s what she was .
A hooker .
Suppose I told you . . .
. . . that everything that happened to you there . . .
. . . the threats , the girl' s warnings . . . . . . her last- minute intervention . . . . . . suppose I said that all of that . . .
. . . was staged .
That it was a kind of charade .
That it was fake .
Fake ?
Yes .
Fake .
Why would they do that ?
Why ?
ln plain words . . . . . . to scare the living shit out of you .
To keep you quiet about where you' d been . . . . . . and what you' d seen .
Have you seen this ?
Yes , I have .
I saw her body in the morgue .
Was she the woman at the party ?
She was .
The woman lying dead in the morgue . . .
. . . was the woman at the party .
Well , Victor , maybe l ' m missing something here .
You called it a fake , a charade .
Do you mind telling me what kind of fucking charade . . . . . . ends with somebody turning up dead ?
Okay , Bill , let' s cut the bullshit .
All right ?
You' ve been way out of your depth for the last 24 hours .
You want to know what kind of charade ?
I' il tell you exactly what kind .
That whole play- acted , " take me " phony sacrifice . . . . . . that you' ve been jerking off with had nothing to do with her real death .
Nothing happened after you left that hadn' t happened to her before .
She got her brains fucked out .
Period .
When they took her home , she was just fine . . . . . . and the rest is in the paper .
She was a junkie .
She OD' d .
There was nothing suspicious .
Her door was locked from the inside .
The police are happy .
End of story .
Come on .
It was always gonna be just a matter of time with her .
Remember , you told her so yourself .
You remember , the one with the great tits who OD' d in my bathroom ?
Listen , Bill , nobody killed anybody .
Someone died .
It happens all the time .
But life goes on .
It always does . . . . . . until it doesn' t .
But you know that , don' t you ?
I' il tell you everything .
I' il tell you everything .
Helena' s gonna be up soon .
She' s expecting us to take her Christmas shopping today .
That' s nice .
I could put Sabrina in here .
It' s really pretty .
It' s old- fashioned .
He' s big .
I hope Santa Claus gets me one of these for Christmas .
You do ?
Well , you ' re gonna have to wait and see .
What do you think we should do ?
What do I think we should do ?
Look , Mommy !
What do I think ?
I don' t know .
I mean , maybe . . . .
Maybe I think . . . . . . we should be grateful .
Grateful . . . . . . that we' ve managed to survive through all of our . . . . . . adventures . . .
. . . whether they were real . . . . . . or only a dream .
Are you sure of that ?
Am I sure ?
Only as sure as I am . . . . . . that the reality of one night . . .
. . . let alone that of a whole lifetime . . .
. . . can ever be the whole truth .
And no dream is ever . . .
. . . just a dream .
The important thing is . . .
. . . we ' re awake now . . .
. . . and hopefully . . .
. . . for a long time to come .
Forever .
Forever ?
Forever .
Let' s not use that word .
You know ?
It frightens me .
But I do love you . . .
. . . and you know . . .
. . . there is something very important . . . . . . that we need to do as soon as possible .
What' s that ?
Fuck .
