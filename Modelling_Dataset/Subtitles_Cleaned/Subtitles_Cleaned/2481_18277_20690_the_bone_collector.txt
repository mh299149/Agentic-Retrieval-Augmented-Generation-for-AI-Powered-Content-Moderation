So where the heII is the car ?

Excuse me ?

Excuse me .
Honey , wake up .
We" re Iost or he" s taking us for a ride .

Shit !

Son of a bitch !

Stop this car !
Good morning .
You" re Iooking a Iittle dehydrated .
How about some juice ?
How about two fingers of vodka ?
A Iittle early for vodka , don" t you think ?
Time , as you know , is a relative consideration .
- Juice .
- Vodka .
- Juice .
- Vodka .
- Coming !
- Join me in a drink , Richard ?
I" d love to .
But a med- tech with Iiquor breath ?
I think not .
Thanks .
So how are you ?
I" m better than your heart- pacing gear .
Every time , it" s skewed further out of spec .
You need a new unit .
I reaIly need a new body .
I can" t help you with that , but I" II bring a new unit by tomorrow .
This" II be stable tiII then .
- Thank you .
- You take it easy .
I" II take it any way I can get it .
- How" s he doing ?
- He asked for a vodka again .
- Did you give him any ?
- No .
- Good morning , doctor .
- Hi , Richard .
Hey , would you Iook at this ?
A peregrine falcon , right ?
He Iikes cripples .
There was a piece about them in the Times nesting aII over the city .
Something about the architecture of these old New York buildings .
I thought he Iiked my company .
They" re a Iittle shy .
Don" t take it personaIly .
Can I get you a drink ?
No , thanks .
I" m fine .
Bed mode .
- Got vodka in there ?
- No .
And you ain" t getting any either .
AII right , I" II Iet you guys talk .
So you can imagine how much sleep I" ve gotten the past few days ... ... considering your request .
Since I made my decision , I" ve been sleeping Iike a baby .
After aII you have survived , beat aII the odds ... ... you know there" s work on nerve regeneration every day .
One finger , two shoulders and a brain .
That" s aII I have , Barry .
These dysreflexia seizures are occurring more often .
The buildup of fluid in my spine is a degenerative condition .
We know I" m waiting for the seizure that" II make me a vegetable .
I don" t wanna be a vegetable , Barry .
I want to make the finaI transition on my own terms .
I" II get it done with or without you .
Yeah , I suppose you would .
So ?
- Okay .
- Okay what ?
Okay , I" II assist you ...
- ... in your transition .
- Today ?
There are preparations to be made .
This is not a flu shot .
My business is in order .
Bags are packed .
Besides , I" ve got a medicaI conference to go to .
I" ve got a plane to catch .
You" re Iying .
When do you get back ?

Get out before you change your mind .

Yeah , I" II race you to the door .
Barry ....
You are ... ... a very good friend .

You okay ?
Yeah , I" m fine .
I just couldn" t sleep .

I gotta shower .
No , you don" t .
Stay here .
I gotta go .
Make breakfast ?
No , thanks .
I" m gonna be Iate .
Another slam- bam- thank- you- ma" am ?
AII right , Iook ....
My therapist teIls me ... ... I don" t get what I need out of this relationship .
What are we doing here ?
I think you and me , we make a great couple .
You know where I stand on this .
You know what I want .
Steve , we" ve been through this .
AII right ?
I care about you .
I can" t make a commitment .
WeIl , go to work then .
You" re gonna be Iate .
- You" re quitting the cops ?
- I" m transferring to Youth Services .
Lucky fuck .
You must have one heII of a rabbi .
- We" re gonna miss you .

Kid found something over at the tracks .
- Finish eating .
I" II check it out .
- See you , kid .
3- post- 1 1 , anything further on that 10- 10 ?
Nothing yet .
Wait .
I think I see him .
Are you the one who caIled the police ?
Wait there , okay ?
Are you crazy ?
Just shut off the engine .
There" s been a homicide .
I can" t Iet you through .
What" s your name ?
Chris .
I got a job for you .
Here" s money .
I need you to buy me one of those cheapo cardboard cameras .
You know , the ones you can throw away ?
Fast as you can .
3- post- 1 1 to Central .
Captain Cheney , Detective Solomon .
First officer on the scene is over there . -- on the tracks near the body .
I coIlected it before it was washed away .
- I also took some pictures .
- Thanks .
You stopped the train ?
It might have disturbed the physicaI evidence .
Why not shut down Grand CentraI while you" re at it ?
Patrolman Donahue .
Is that right ?
Donaghy .
A rookie , I take it .
No , sir .
Pretty dumb .
Captain ... ... guess who the vic is ?
- Talk to me .
- Alan fucking Rubin .
Mister " Rebuild New York " himself ?
No one enters this area except for my crime scene guys .
Knight to h6 .
Check .
You got company .
Cops .
- TeII them I" m busy .
- They said it was urgent .
TeII them I" m out running .
She" s too polite for that , Linc .
Hey , Iook who" s here !
I caught a serious situation .
It" s going around , Paulie .
Chief Murphy sent me .
The good chief .
Heard about that couple at the airport ?
Got in a taxi , never got home ?
He don" t watch the news .
You used to read four papers a day and tape the news shows .
Yeah , now I just hit the rewind button .
A3 .
Things never change .
That was Alan Rubin and his wife in that taxi .
They found him dead , buried , shot in the face ... ... hand sticking out of the ground with his wife" s ring on his finger ... ... which was skinned to the bone .
She" s stiII missing .
Excuse me while you catch up .
Don" t go too far .
We" II be Ietting these nice gentlemen out in 30 seconds .
Sounds Iike you got yourself an open- and- shut there .
I don" t think so .
A man worth severaI hundred miIlion found dead ... ... his wife" s ring on his mutilated hand .
What" s that teII you ?
The doer is saying he" s got her .
He" s probably making a ransom demand right now .
- I" d have been paged .
- Check your batteries .
It" s definitely a ransom .
Excuse me , Mr. Rhyme .
Kenneth Solomon .
I" ve read aII your books .
Scene of the Crime , at Ieast a dozen times .
It" s great to meet you .
- Where do you find these guys ?
- They wanna work with the best .
I guess now you" re gonna ask me to discuss the crime scene with you .
We got a bunch of physicaI evidence that doesn" t exactly make sense .
Some seriously weird stuff .
It" s aII in the report .
Thelma ?
You okay ?
- Linc , you okay ?
- Out !
Now !
- Anything we can do ?
- Asses out of here now !
Let me get you some air .
Come on .
Breathe for me .
I said out !
Come on .
Deep breaths .
Deep breaths .
Come on .
Deep breaths .
I" m getting a BP on you .
You gotta breathe .
Look at me .
Breathe .
Look at me .
Deep breaths .
Come on .
Come on .
You gotta take this oxygen .
Stay with me .
Come on .
You can do it .
Don" t go out on me now .
Come on .
Look at me .
- Thelma ?
- You okay ?
I would be if your powers of resuscitation were Iess adept .
Look , not on my shift , aII right ?
If you have a problem , you can fire my ass .
I provide for you in my wiIl .
You ought to keep that in mind .
Rhyme , I" m not interested in having this conversation .
Okay ?
The crime scene report SeIlitto Ieft ....
Could you take the photos and Ioad them in the viewer ?
View scan .
Let" s take a Iook at what we got here .
Where it says Iocation ....
Now what" s that -- ?
What" s it say about that newspaper ? " Newspaper found beneath a coarse- thread hex bolt ... ... with 4 p . m . circled on it . "
Zoom .
Zoom .
What about that piece of paper ?
What" s the number on there ?
" A torn book page with 1 1 9 on it . "
1 1 9 , 4 p . m .
1 1 9 , 4 p . m .
1 1 - 9 .
What" s today" s date ?
Today" s November 9 .
Phone mode .
SeIlitto , Paulie .
CaIl .
What ?
Sad fact is , a huge percentage of inner- city kids ... ... have their first drug experiences ... ... at the fifth grade Ievel .
Here are some of the drugs they" II be offered .
Marijuana .
How" d you Iike to get your hands on that briefcase ?
Barbiturates .
Amphetamines .
Cocaine .
Rock cocaine .
- What" s this about ?
- You know who Lincoln Rhyme is ?
- What ?
The textbook guy ?
- Yeah .
- So what does that have to do with me ?
- You" II find out .
Come on in .
They" re in there .
A patroI cop took these pictures ?
Yeah , first one on the scene .
It started to rain .
Smart cop .
Had the baIls to stop an Amtrak from running over the crime scene .
Here she is now .
Officer Donahoe ... ... meet Lincoln Rhyme .
Donaghy .
You took terrific photographs .
You know who I am ?
I read your manuaI at the academy .
What" d you think ?
I" m not a book critic .
You found it useful ?
I guess so .
Sure you did .
You stopped that train .
The photos you took .
I" d say you have a naturaI instinct for forensics .
So what do we got , Paulie ?
We have footprints , size 1 0 , thanks to Officer Donaghy ... ... using a doIlar biII to establish scale .
We have asbestos where there shouldn" t be any .
An iron bolt holding down a piece of paper ... ... a book page with 1 1 9 written on it .
Decaying oxidation on the bolt ... ... but none on the thread .
Someone removed it ... ... from somewhere else ... ... and placed it there recently .
Wouldn" t you agree , officer ?
Wouldn" t you agree , Officer Donaghy ?
Paulie , I" m convinced this crime scene was staged .
- Perp" s teIling us something .
- What ?
Book , page 1 1 9 .
1 1 - 9 .
That" s today" s date .
Newspaper , 4 p . m .
What time you got ?
1 2 :
1 5 .
She" s alive .
- And he" s gonna kiII her at 4 ?
- P. M.
We have your interest yet ?
I want you to work the case with us .
It" s not my area .
Are you being modest , or are you ... ... uneasy about doing some reaI police work ?
Excuse me ?
What department do you work in ?
Youth Services .
I picked her up at orientation .
I see .
Youth Services .
I wait- Iisted a year , and I won" t jeopardize --
Jeopardize what ?
Cushy desk job ?
- Forensics is not my area .
- I disagree with you .
You can" t force me to take this assignment .
I can .
And if I refuse ?
You" re putting your career at risk .
You think because of your condition you can push people around ?
That is truly pathetic .
Truly ?
Yeah , damn right .
Truly .
WeIl , forgive me truly ... ... if I insist on having someone with your brains ... ... and a fresh pair of eyes .
There" s a Iife at stake here , officer .
We" II need key people and tech support .
I know the guys .
What the heII you smiling at ?
PuII up a chair .
TeII me everything you know about the crime scene .
It" s in my report .
I read your report .
I want to know what you felt ... ... what you feel ... ... in the deepest recesses of your senses .
You are in love with the sound of your voice , aren" t you ?
It" s your voice I want to hear .
Sit down .
I won" t bite .
The rifling on the . 38 slug they dug out of the victim ... ... is consistent with a Webley , an old , turn- of- the- century handgun .
On the big board , please .
What about that bolt ?
There" s three initials on the head :
N. S. G.
And the bolt" s not steel .
It" s iron .
Iron .
Iron .
Iron .
Making it old ... ... Iike the Webley .
Officer Donaghy , what do you know about asbestos ?
It kiIls Americans every day .
Very good .
- You computer Iiterate ?
- A Iittle .
Thelma !
Thelma ?
Where" s my Thelma ?
Thelma , meet Amelia .
Amelia , Thelma .
Amelia hates my books and computers ... ... but she" s got an A- plus nose for evidence ... ... so show her how to access D. E. P. files .
See if there" s any Iarge asbestos cleanups going on in the city .
ASAP .
- Where is Eddie Ortiz ?
- Right here !
How" s the world" s crankiest criminalist ?
Playing " beat the clock . "
Everybody" s worst nightmare .
Get in a cab , and there" s a psycho from Jersey behind the wheel .
We don" t know he" s from Jersey .
Yeah , Bayonne .
It" s the toxins in the water over there .
You bring the whole Iab ?
- Mom always told me to be prepared .
- Where do you want this ?
Put it over here in the corner .
How is your mother ?
She" s 76 , and she" s shtupping a guy named Morris .
Can you believe that ?
God bless her .
But it" s Morris I" m worried about .
He" s 79 with a tricky ticker and an active pecker .
- Afternoon .
Captain Cheney .
- Amelia ... ... what about that asbestos ?
There" s a dozen cleanups in the five boroughs .
Put it up on the viewer for me .
Narrow it down to the oldest Iocations .
How you doing , Howie ?
Fine .
How" s it going ?
In the middle of the middle , as you can see .
Look what I found on the threading of that iron bolt .
I was hoping to grab a minute if you don" t mind .
Excuse me .
Sorry .
Sorry .
We got Donaghy to thank for photographing the cruciaI evidence .
CruciaI evidence ?
We don" t know that .
I wanted to make sure you had the support you need .
I" m putting the fuII resources of my department here at your disposal .
I appreciate it .
Thank you .
But the thing is , Linc ... ... I" ve formalized procedures since you were in charge , and so --
Put what you got up on my screen , please .
So I" d appreciate it if you kept me in the Ioop .
Absolutely .
At aII times .
At aIl --
What the heII is that we" re Iooking at ?
Old paper .
Coarse grade .
I" d say ... ... 80 , 90 years old .
Turn- of- the- century , it Iooks Iike .
The perp Iikes old .
Fine , then ....
I" II be in my office if you need me .
Yeah , okay , Howie .
Good .
Old paper .
Old gun .
Buries his victim in a vintage CiviI War railroad bed .
Sand .
Sand .
Sand ....
Eddie , what do you got on the sand ?
Doesn" t reaIly Iook Iike sand .
- I" m not sure .
- Can you individuate it ?
If I had an EDX , I could .
We don" t have a goddamn E- the- fuck- X.
Look who forgot their chiII piII this morning .
Excuse me .
Come on .
I" m aII over this thing now .
Okay , we" re talking ... ... pearly- Iooking .
Some kind of a ... ... sheIlfish or something .
Oyster sheIls , maybe ?
Could be .
Definitely .
If I had to bet on it , I" d say it was .
Sure .
I got it .
The oldest asbestos sites are coming up now .
In 1 91 3 , when the Woolworth Building was being built ... ... workmen found the body of a rich industrialist , Talbot Soames .
He" d been kidnapped , shot and buried in what they thought was sand .
Turned out to be oyster sheIls .
Crushed oyster sheIls .
That" s what they used as IandfiII in Iower Manhattan .
That" s how PearI Street got its name .
That" s where Mrs. Rubin wiII be .
She" II be underground .
She" II be in a basement ... ... near or in the Woolworth Building .
Have Emergency Services Unit meet us by the Woolworth Building .
TeII them to start their search .
We may get Iucky .
Eddie , did you bring your van ?
- It" s downstairs .
- We" II need it .
Throw your keys to Amelia .
You guys go with her .
Should I go too ?
You stay here with me and work that bolt .
That" s the missing piece .
Should we keep Cheney in the Ioop ?
Fuck him .
Fuck him .
Amelia .
Just trust me .
Just foIlow those instincts you were born with .
I" II be with you ... ... every step of the way .
Jesus , 25 minutes Ieft .
- How did Rhyme get that way ?
- He was born briIliant .
It happens .
I mean , the physicaI part .
Four years ago , he was working the body of a cop ... ... they" d found shot in a subway tunnel .
Beam came down and damn near cut him in half .
Jesus .
Family ?
Sister in Phoenix .
He never sees her .
Cut himself off .
TechnicaIly , he" s stiII on active duty coIlecting pay .
Insurance picks up 24- hour care and the gadgets .
On weekends , always one or two cops there Iending a hand .
- Tough deal .
- You won" t hear him complaining .
He Iikes pushing other people" s buttons .
In your case , that" s a compliment .
You gotta Iearn to relax around a compliment , especiaIly from Rhyme .
- You can be a Iittle grating .
- Me ?
Kiddo , if you were any more wound up , you" d be a Timex .
He was a human dynamo , writing books , lecturing all over the world ... ... giving expert opinion in trials , working crimes in the city .
You know what he" d do for fun ?
No , I can" t imagine .
He" d coIlect things .
Dirt , metals , plastics ... ... hubcaps , plants , musical strings ... ... medicaI tools , anything .
Obsessive .
He" d analyse and catalogue it for his , what you caII it , database .
Jesus Christ !
I" d Iike to get there in one piece if possible .
- New York Security Gate Company .
- That" s good .
What else ?
Nicholas Steven Gerard , elevators .
- No , underground .
- A subway builder .
- Subway builder sounds -- - Excuse me !
N. S. G.
" Niagara Steam Generation .
Bought by Eastern Gas and Electric in 1 928 .
The six- inch iron bolt was used mainly for steam pipe assemblies . "
You got 1 1 minutes .
Where are you ?
We just hit the financial district .
There" s a steam junction ... ... with big asbestos- coated pipes .
That" s where she" II be .
I" d bet my Iegs on it .
She" II be at WaII and Nassau .
- Wall and Nassau .
- Has ESU been notified ?
On their way .
They`il get there first .
Steam is released through that junction every day at 4 p . m .
Shit , what`s this asshole up to ?
I don`t know , but it`il happen in about 10 minutes .
We" re here .
We" re going down there .
Amelia ?
Yeah , I" m here .
It" s their job to save Mrs. Rubin .
It" s yours to get ready ... ... and work the crime scene if necessary .
There`s some things you`il need .
Look in the truck .
You" II see an aluminum suitcase ... ... and a radio headset .
See it ?
Yeah , I see them .
There must be a way in .
- What" s the problem here ?
- Fucking valves freeze up easy .
Come on .
Shut it off !
You there ?
I`m here .
I" m inside the pipe .
Go !
I think I hear something .
I hear something !
What`s that ?
Someone`s there .
I hear her crying !
Everyone , quiet now !
Mrs. Rubin ?
Mrs. Rubin ?
She" s there .
Mrs. Rubin !
We" re on our way in now !
Come on , guys .
Come on .
Let" s go !
Let" s go !
Let" s hurry the fuck up !
Get a driII and a tap .
Somebody cut this halfway through .
There`s no way to turn it off .
Back !
Paulie ?
Paulie ?
She" s gone .
The whole place is scalded in steam .
Let" s go !
Move away !
ESU are gonna blow a hole in the subbasement waIl .
I understand I" m working with Chief Murphy" s authorization .
That" s right .
I don`t want Emergency Services guys in there trampling the evidence ... ... before we run the scene .
What do you want ?
When they blow the hole , I want Donaghy in .
She" s not trained for this .
We could get our asses in a sling .
My ass has been in a sling for four years .
TeII Hanson and his beasts that" s what I want .
AII right .
You got it .
Okay , Iet" s move !
I" m doing this under protest .
The perp could stiII be in there !
Rhyme" s in charge , and they" re his orders .
You can" t handle it in there , get your ass out .
Amelia , you ready ?
You Iisten to me .
I" m with you every step of the way .
Go on .
Good Iuck .
- I`m in .
- TeII me what you see .
Everything`s been boiled to hell .
Oh , God .
What is it ?
It" s an awfuI smeIl .
You" re close .
I can" t believe I" m doing this .
You`re fine .
Just fine .
You" re doing great .
Now , just remember the academy .
When you walk ... ... move in a straight line .
Don`t disturb any footprints he`s left .
Yeah , assuming he" s gone .
There`s no footprints .
There`s nothing yet .
Oh , God .
What ?
Talk to me .
Talk to me , Amelia .
I can see her .
The steam pipe was opened ... ... and she`s tied down right in front of it .
There" s nothing you can do .
You can" t do anything but help her ... ... by working the crime scene .
That" s your job .
Open your suitcase .
Get your camera .
I can" t do this .
You can do it .
Yes , you can .
Yesterday you stopped a train .
You can do anything you want .
Don" t work me , Rhyme .
Just tell me what to do next .
Very slowly , walk the grid ... ... one foot in front of the other .
I want you to look around you now .
Crime scenes are three- dimensional .
Floors , waIls and ceilings .
Rhyme .
Yeah , I`m here .
There" s something strange .
Things he left for us ?
Yes .
In a cluster again ?
A piece of wood ... ... and looks like some hair .
I" II walk you through coIlecting the evidence .
Do exactly as I say .
Oh , Jesus .
Talk to me .
- It" s a bloody bone .
- Where is it ?
It" s in my fucking hand .
Human ?
I think so .
Yeah .
Photograph it .
Bag it .
Okay , that" s it .
I" m out of here .
One more thing .
We gotta process the body .
What ?
I`m not a medical examiner .
I can`t do that .
It`s not an autopsy .
I just want you to ....
Just describe the restraints .
They" re strange- Iooking handcuffs .
They Iook more Iike old shackles or something .
And there`s a chain across her waist .
And her feet are bound with a rope .
Hands above her head ?
There" s also a Iarge piece of flesh ... ... missing from her right forearm .
It" s right down to the bone .
It was surgicaIly removed .
This is what I want you to do .
We" re gonna need those handcuffs .
It`s probably our best chance for good prints .
The M. E. can remove them .
M. E. is aII thumbs .
They" II mess up the prints .
Look in the suitcase .
There" s a smaII saw .
I want you to saw her hands off at the wrist Iine .
We gotta have those cuffs for prints .
I can" t .
Cut her hands off .
We need the handcuffs .
I can" t .
No .
Saw off her hands .
Take off the cuffs .
I can" t .
Listen to me .
We need those cuffs .
I can" t !
- Amelia , we need -- - No !
Fuck you !
Amelia !
Amelia !
If he wants her hands cut off , he can come and do it himself !
That" II be $1 6 . 50 .
Who is it ?
Hey , take it easy !
- Solomon , what are you doing ?
- Are you okay ?
What the fuck are you doing ?
Rhyme" s been trying to caII you for hours .
Your phone" s down .
He was concerned .
My phone" s fine .
I don" t need his concern .
He needs you at his place right away .
I don" t work for Lincoln Rhyme .
He thinks the evidence says there" s another vic in play .
And he" s Iaying that at my feet ?
Don" t shoot the messenger .
Did you just move in ?
Yeah , about a year ago .
ReaIly ?
You were a model .
Yeah , when I was a kid .
Kid modeI to street cop .
There" s a Ieap .
For whatever it" s worth ... ... I thought what you did today was terrific .
Hey , you guys , I" m out of here .
I" II grab a cab .
I got a paper to finish .
- I" m gonna hang .
- No problem .
I" II be there in a minute .
Can I finish that ?
Go for it .
I" II see you outside .
Taxi !
That bone" s definitely not human .
- And the hair ?
- Not human either .
WeIl , what is it ?
I" m working as fast as I can .
Glad to see you could join us .
I got Cheney on the Iine .
He wants you to brief him .
TeII him I" II caII him back .
Two things .
First , you did a heII of a job Iocating the evidence .
There" s no question the perp knows forensics .
Now , as for the other thing ...
... the victim" s hands , weIl , maybe ... ... it was too much to handle .
Forget it .
Is that your version of an apology ?
An apology ?
Is that why you came over here ?
You reaIly are a piece of work .
WeIl , aren" t we a pair ?
I think you" re terrific .
You got a heII of an arrest record .
High marks from aII your bosses .
Definite gold- shield potential .
Why you wanna throw it away to chase youth offenders ?
I have no need to explain that to you .
Come on , cop to cop .
Cop to cop , Iet" s just Ieave it at personaI reasons .
Doesn" t have anything to do with your father , does it ?
You keep charging at waIls .
Stubbornness is something we both share .
They say we come into this world with a preordained destiny .
I don" t believe it .
Neither of my parents had more than an eighth- grade education .
Never read more than one book between them , not one .
I" ve read thousands .
I" ve written a dozen .
What" s your point ?
My point is that destiny is what you make it .
What happened to your dad won" t necessarily happen to you .
You" re a great cop .
You" d make a terrific detective .
It" s a gift .
Don" t throw it away .
Report from the Taxi Commission .
An NYU student was abducted Iast night .
His girlfriend saw him try to get out ... ... as the taxi driver hit him with a flashlight .
No description of the driver .
Okay , everybody .
This could be our next victim .
Did you get a deadline off that evidence yet ?
Not yet .
That" s something I hoped you" d help me with .
Anyone for some osso buco ?
What ?
The bone we found at the WaII Street scene .
VeaI shank .
Braised and overly salted to boot .
A cow bone ?
I also found a piece of that old paper ... ... embedded in the bone .
Take a Iook .
- What" s going on ?
- Do what you need to do quickly .
The hair foIlicles , they" re not human .
A rodent .
Probably a rat .
They were shaved off .
We" re Iooking for a rat that shaves .
- I Iike that .
- I" ve known a few in my time .
- How about you , Amelia ?
- More than a few .
He" s consistent with underground , that" s for sure .
What" s he trying to say ?
He" s communicating in our Ianguage ... ... Ieaving clues , forensic clues at that .
Maybe it" s a cop .
Maybe .
Maybe he" s sharing the responsibility of these murders .
If we don" t figure out the clues , the blood" s on our hands .
If we can" t find the victim , we" re as responsible for the murders as he is .
What do you got on that dirt from the wood ?
I don" t have 1 00°/ ° individuated , but it does appear nitrogen- rich .
Ready to rock " n " roIl .
Thanks for rushing .
I appreciate it .
Thank you , Richard .
Nitrogen- rich , explosive carbons .
Where do you find those in New York ?
Bomb sites .
- Shooting ranges .
- Maybe an old fort or an armoury ?
Don" t forget the shit factor .
The what ?
Manure becomes a nitrate when it" s aged .
That" s true .
Then you got cow bones , huh ?
Old cow bones .
Old manure .
Turn- of- the- century .
Cows , farms , pastures .
Rats .
Dead cows .
Where do you find -- ?
In stockyards .
Look for slaughterhouses .
Stockyards and slaughterhouses from turn of the century .
Check the Internet .
I want tax records , sanitation records and building- code inspections .
Last 1 00 years .
Okay ?
Man , your blood pressure is way up .
- You" re pushing it too hard .
- I understand .
- What do we got on the stockyards ?
- We" re almost there .
You okay ?
No , I" m not okay .
I can" t figure out this time Iine or these shards of cardboard .
We got three defunct stockyard sites .
One on Lexington and the Harlem River viaduct .
Solomon , put the box down ... ... turn the viewer on and mark it down as she caIls them off .
Your blood pressure wiII blow a gasket if you don" t slow down .
My body has a mind of its own .
It doesn" t Iisten to me .
What else ?
There" s another on the Hudson up at 1 55th .
Mark it down , Solomon .
Your sats are going down .
You saw him have a seizure .
What else ?
There" s one underground at Greenwich and Houston .
Mark it down .
- Why don" t you knock it off ?
- I don" t need to knock it off !
What was the first one you mentioned ?
Lexington and the Harlem River viaduct .
When did it close ?
1 91 0 .
Okay , what about ... ... Houston and Greenwich ?
1 898 .
And Hudson and 1 55th was closed in 1 906 .
1 906 , 1 898 --
AII right , Iet" s .... 1 898 .
Houston and Greenwich .
CaII Emergency Services and teII them ... ... to meet us at Houston and Greenwich .
Solomon , you get on to Hanson .
He" II need about 20 guys .
You go with them .
Let" s go .
Linc , you there ?
Yeah , ready .
We`re here .
All right .
Same drill .
I want you in first .
Let" s do it .
You watch yourself , Amelia .
Oh , man .
I don" t Iike this .
I don" t Iike this .
I got a bad feeling about this .
All three of us ought to get in there .
Not yet .
Just hold back .
I`m going down some stairs .
Cement waIls .
Wood crates .
Large columns .
Smells like manure down here .
Ortiz sure knows his shit .
Always has .
MetaI hooks ... ... and a pen .
It" s a slaughterhouse .
ESU are here .
Hold them off .
Don" t want them contaminating the scene .
AII right , hold it .
Hold up .
Hold up .
- You" re not to go in .
- Why ?
- Rhyme" s orders .
- Fuck him !
Get me Cheney on the Iine .
Crime scene C. O. on air .
- Switch to channel 2- 2 for ESU .
- Fuck Rhyme .
Maybe this one" s stiII alive .
Perp didn" t Ieave a deadline .
What does that mean ?
We" re probably too Iate .
You don" t know that , Rhyme .
Get off the Iine .
Let" s move on , Amelia .
There" s 5 basic contaminants to every crime scene .
I" II skip to the worst one .
Other cops .
I think I hear something .
I hate this shit .
I see something .
I think I found him .
I can`t tell if he`s alive .
Oh , Jesus .
He" s covered in rats .
They`re all over him .
- We" re going in .
- No , you" re not !
Go !
Go !
Central , we have shots fired .
Shots fired .
You were right .
We never had a shot .
He cut him up pretty bad and Ieft him for the rats .
There" s a cut in his Ieg down to the bone .
The blood attracted the rats .
Goddamn son of a bitch .
You okay ?
I" m fine .
Step aside so I can walk the grid .
Let" s give her some room .
Move it , guys .
Rhyme , I`m gonna walk the grid .
You know what to do .
I found it .
Another cluster .
A piece of old paper like the other two .
And a matchbox .
Bring that black suitcase over here .
Pull out the brown envelope .
Sounds Iike you" re starting to enjoy this work .
Damn !
The press is here .
Park it right there .
Lincoln Rhyme is no Ionger working this case .
I" m taking over .
Do what you want to do , but you ought to check with Murphy first .
Fuck Murphy and fuck Rhyme .
This has been cleared downtown .
We got a dead kid on our hands ... ... and I , for one , am not taking the heat for that .
TeII Ortiz and his crew to vacate Rhyme" s place tonight .
The victim was already dead when we arrived .
And you , half- assed patrolman working a crime scene ... ... those days are over .
I" II take that evidence bag now .
You can take it with a chain- of- custody voucher .
Are you out of your mind ?
Let`s go .
You`re coming with us .
Are you arresting me ?
Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut to the press .
You won" t find any prints .
He" s too good for that .
It Iooks Iike we have a nice , clean friction print .
Unless of course , it" s yours .
No , I was wearing gloves .
We" II know soon enough .
Put this through .
Highest priority .
- You got it .
- Thank you .
This perp" s been in business for a Iong time .
I hear you , but you know , it" s Cheney" s problem now .
Yeah , that" s what scares me .
See if there" s been any homicides in the Iast 1 2 months ... ... involving surgicaIly- removed flesh exposing bone .
No problem .
See you soon .
Hope so , Eddie .
Thelma , don" t you Iet him run no circles around you .
Stay right , Eddie .
Oh , that print .
We just got a positive I. D. on it .
The guy has three extremely violent priors .
Oh , Iook at that .
Taxi Iicense , no Iess .
We got him .
Let" s go , boys !
Somebody caII ESU .
Now slide out , nice and easy .
That explains your print .
He" s hoping you" d show up .
He" s been worried about you .
Yeah , sure .
I didn" t expect to see you again .
Poor Cheney , huh ?
Grabbed the baII with both hands , scored for the other team .
I warned him that the perp was too smart to Ieave a print .
How you doing with that stuff ?
Not too good .
Two pieces of the puzzle , but I don" t know what it means .
Maybe this" II help .
Cheney wiII have your badge for that .
He wouldn" t give me a voucher .
What could I do ?
You could take it back to him .
The man is a Iiving monument to ineptitude .
True .
Let" s take a Iook .
What do you got there ?
Third piece of the puzzle .
There" s something reaIly strange about it , though .
You gotta smeII it .
Sure .
- WeIl , you -- - Shoot .
Sorry .
It" s okay .
Take your time .
You have to put it closer to my nose .
What do you think it is ?
Kerosene ?
Possibly .
This just came in from Eddie Ortiz .
Could you Ioad these into the computer for me ?
Sorry about that , Thelma .
ECU .
View scan .
" Dear Linc , I am enclosing photos of four unsolved homicides ... ... which took place in the Iast 1 2 months .
Flesh has been removed from the victims " extremities .
I miss you .
Love , Eddie . "
I" II spare myself the pleasure if you don" t mind .
Zoom .
Same mark .
Right .
Zoom .
Zoom .
Zoom .
Same messages .
It" s him .
He was trying to make contact even then .
But Cheney never put it together .
Dysreflexia seizure .
A bad one .
Hang on .
Hang on .
Breathe , Rhyme .
Come on , breathe with me .
Damn catheter" s blocked .
Just Iet me get a BP on you .
Stay with me !
Breathe .
Hang on .
Hang on .
Just Iet me check you .
Diastolic" s over 1 25 .
I gotta get it down now .
Just give it a few seconds to work .
Come on , breathe with me .
Come on .
Hang on , man .
Is he gonna make it ?
If he does , he won" t be happy .
What are you talking about ?
He" s finalized arrangements to self- terminate .
He convinced some doctor to help with his finaI transition , as he caIls it .
But suicide ?
It" s the seizures .
Any one of them could put him into a vegetative state .
That" s what he fears more than anything .
Who is it ?
Captain Cheney .
Can I help you ?
Police business .
Open up .
Mr. Rhyme is asleep .
WeIl , wake him up .
I need to see him now .
Let me deaI with this asshole .
You watch him .
Anything , just caII me .
He" s aII right .
Look , Iady .
I hope you know that obstructing justice is a felony offense .
Look , don" t " Iady " me .
Unless you have a warrant , you can" t come in here .
I" m coming in .
I have reason to believe there" s stolen evidence in there .
What" s your fuII name ?
Thelma what ?
So you wanna get official ?
What did you say your name was ?
You got a smart mouth and it" II get you in trouble .
It may bite your ass if you don" t stop aggravating my patient .
I" m gonna Ieave now , but I" II be back .
And when I come back , it" II be with a warrant .
And I Iooked everywhere .
And I thought the conductor would be angry .
And I kept searching everywhere , and finaIly ... ... it was right on my Iap .
Grandma can" t wait to see you , you know .
What" d I do ?
You" re carrying a fare and your metre" s not on ... ... and your hack Iicense is not properly --
There" s Iaws against molesting the handicapped , you know .
I wasn" t a pretty sight , was I ?
Thelma told me about your finaI transition .
Cop to cop , that subject" s not open to discussion .
Why ?
Would you miss me ?
WeIl , destiny" s what we make it , right ?
Touché .
You seem to have your reasons for " checking out . "
I expected more from someone Iike you .
WeIl , I might surprise you ... ... and Iive forever .
Nothing you" d do would surprise me .
WeIl , Iook who" s stiII in the Iand of the Iiving .
For the moment .
Cheney was here huffing and puffing .
- He promised to return with a warrant .
- Sorry I missed him .
If that" s him , teII him ...
- Say no more . - ... I" m skiing .
Hey , Paulie .
Hang on .
I don" t know if it" s just a coincidence ... ... but an inspector was kiIled by a cabby who was off the metre .
The thing is , a male witness who wouldn" t give his name ... ... saw the taxi with an old man and a little girl inside .
Probably the doer that caIled .
Jesus , he" s got a kid .
And an old man .
Thank you , Paulie .
We" d better Iook closer at that third piece of the puzzle .
Close .
Three murders .
Three evidence clusters .
Three pieces of paper .
View scan .
You" re the queen of puzzles .
What do you see ?
I" m Iooking .
I" m Iooking .
Lower the Iittle one .
That one .
Twist that big one around .
Doesn" t that kind of Iook Iike a face ?
Mouth , nose , eye .
Enhance .
Fade .
A woman" s face .
Yes , it is .
It" s a Iogo .
An old ... ... turn- of- the- century ... ... publisher" s Iogo .
You know it ?
I used to own a few of the books .
Gothic stories .
Crime stories .
The kiIler is pointing us to an old book .
Can I help you ?
I caIled about old crime books .
Around the corner .
Help yourself .
Thanks .
Aviation Two to Central .
We`re taking a flyby at the Brooklyn Bridge .
Report appears unfounded at this time .
Will check East River shoreline and advise .
I need more smaII boats to search under the piers .
By the heliport .
Under the piers .
It was the Iast murder in the book .
They" ve gotta be along the shore .
Listen , the lab says the odour we smelled ... ... on the third piece of the puzzle is probably dieseI fuel .
There`s an old boat refuelling station at the Staten Island Ferry pier .
Check the pilings under the pier .
Found them !
Over here !
Here !
Here !
I can see someone with a light ... ... signalling us from the old Staten Island Ferry pier .
There appears to be two bodies in the water .
Be advised , subject signalling is most likely NYPD officer .
Over here !
Here !
Watch the pilings !
We`ve got divers coming in to you now .
Over to the ladder .
Be advised , aideds are out of the water ... ... and ESU is working on them at this time .
Rhyme , are you there ?
We`re too late .
Forget it .
He" s dead .
The old man" s gone .
They`re working on the girl , but it doesn`t look good .
Try again .
I know she" s stiII there .
Come on , kid .
Come on .
Try for me .
Come on .
You can do it .
Come on .
Breathe .
Breathe .
She" s breathing .
She" II be okay .
She" s breathing .
Can you hear me ?
- I think she`s gonna make it .
- Good .
Good .
You gotta find the clues that he left for us .
See what you can find around the fueI tanks .
All right .
I found it .
It" s a map of some kind , some chunk of a clean bone ... ... and a piece of a medal or a badge or something .
There" s initials engraved .
It Iooks Iike ... ... a P and a B.
It" s definitely a D.
P. D. Sounds Iike a cop" s badge .
Think he" II kiII a cop ?
Could be .
Maps ?
TeII me about the map .
Looks Iike an old subway map .
I don" t recognize the stations .
When I scanned asbestos sites , I came across ... ... stations that aren`t in use anymore .
There it is .
The oldest station .
On your map , is there an old station indicated at the tip of Manhattan ?
Navy Street .
It`s right next to the pier .
Oh , shit .
Cheney" s here .
You talking to Rhyme on that thing ?
Give me the radio .
This is Cheney .
What the heII do you think you" re doing ?
Stealing evidence is a goddamn felony .
I understand there" s no chain- of- evidence voucher .
Oh , yeah ?
I got some news for you .
You" re not a cop anymore .
Understand ?
What you are is a fucking meddling cripple .
I" m gonna place your Iittle gofer under arrest .
You don`t mind that , do you ?
Lock her up .
Where" d she go ?
I`m inside the Navy Street tunnel .
There`s grey dust everywhere .
It`s all over my shoes .
There" s footprints .
One set of footprints .
The mobile unit you`ve called is not responding .
Re- caIl .
No dust .
He changed the numbers .
7- 8- 4- 9- 9 .
What is that ?
7- 8- 4- 9- 9 .
What does it mean ?
What does it mean ?
Help me , Rhyme .
Help me .
He" s gonna kiII Rhyme .
Coming .
Hey , what are you doing here ?
Is that Amelia ?
Bed mode .
Thelma , is that you ?
No , it" s me .
Richard .
Richard ?
What" s up ?
Thelma asked me to check the heart- pacing machine .
Where is Thelma ?
Out in the haIl .
Phone mode .
It was time we had a quiet moment together .
You and I , no interruptions .
What" s on your mind ?
I think it" s time to set the record straight .
Syracuse .
You remember Syracuse , don" t you ?
You wrote an expert opinion .
I wrote thousands of opinions .
Don" t fucking teII me you don" t remember Syracuse .
They caIled it an investigation .
It was a witch hunt .
There was a forensics cop up in Syracuse , New York .
Marcus Andrews .
Okay , that was the cop that was suspected ... ... of tampering with evidence in some homicide cases .
- Nothing was tampered with .
- Six innocent people went to jail .
They went to jaiI because they were guilty .
They were scum .
- He doctored the reports .
- Nothing was doctored .
He planted blood evidence .
My work was impeccable .
Where are we going with this ... ... Marcus ?
Your report destroyed my Iife .
My report was not a IegaI finding .
- You never Iet me defend myself .
- I never even met you .
I was sent to prison for six years !
I spent two more years getting to you .
Do you know what happens to a cop in jail ?
Every day , every single day ... ... over and over , I was brutalized .
I became a human toilet ... ... because of your expert opinion .
WeIl , you wiII never point the finger of blame at anyone ever again .
You were never as good as they said .
I played you .
I tested you .
I gave you every clue .
You and your helper couldn" t save them .
Their blood is on your hands .
You failed .
You failed , you fuck .
Game of chess , Mr. Rhyme .
Some people win .
Some people Iose .
I win , Mr. Rhyme .
I win .
You Iose .
Which vegetable would you Iike to be ?
A carrot ?
How about a zucchini ?
Zucchini ?
You wanna be a zucchini ?
I" m sorry , I didn" t hear you .
Did you say zucchini ?
You want to play ?
ShaII we cut out your tongue , Mr. Rhyme ?
How about your eye ?
Your eye ?
I" II just pop it out of there .
Let" s Ieave that for now .
You can watch me .
You can watch me while I gut you open right down the middle .
What ?
What ?
Can you hear me ?
Oh , God .
Step aside .
We" II take care of him .
- I" ve always loved this view .
- I Iike it too , doc .
It" s Iooking better every day .

You got an operating Iicense for that ?
I got a Iearner" s permit .

He play golf .
Playing golf ?
Captain Flash on wheels .

Merry Christmas , everyone .
If you be cruising , you might as weII be amusing .

Come on in .
Merry Christmas .

- Merry Christmas , Uncle Linc .
- Give me a kiss .
Merry Christmas , Kimmy .

On the phone .
