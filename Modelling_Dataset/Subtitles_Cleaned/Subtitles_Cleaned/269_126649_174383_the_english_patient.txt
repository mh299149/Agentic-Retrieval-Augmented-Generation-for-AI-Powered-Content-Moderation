- [.] Just wait .
Don' t look at anything yet .
Wait .
Kip !
Oh , thank you !
Mmm !
If one night I didn' t come to see you , what would you do ?
I' d try not to expect you .
Yes , but if it got late and ...
I hadn' t shown up ?
Then I' d think there must be a reason .
You wouldn' t come to find me ?
Hmm .
That makes me never want to come here .
Then I' d tell myself , he spends all day searching .
In the night , he wants to be found .
I do .
I do want you to find me .
I do want to be found .
I was looking for Lieutenant Singh .
- He' s sleeping .
- Only we' ve got to go to work .
I' il tell him .
What is it ?
Is it a mine ?
It' s a bomb by a viaduct .
- Does he have to go ?
- Beg pardon ?
What if you couldn' t find him ?
Sergeant , not today .
Not this morning .
- What' s happening ?
Am I needed ?
- Afraid so , Sir .
Don' t go .
I' m frightened .
This is what I do .
I do this every day .
Hardy !
Serial number K - K- I- P ... 2- 6- 0- 0 .
K - K- I- P 2600 , Sir !
I' il get the oxygen .
Hardy , what' s happening ?
Can' t see , Sir !
It' s from the road !
Corporal ?
Tanks , Sir !
I don' t know what it' s about !
- Stop ' em !
- Stop !
Stop !
- Hardy !
- Stop !
Stop !
What is this , a bloody carnival ?
The fuse has snapped !
What' s happened ?
Is it armed ?
Hang on a second .
I' il be right with you .
Can you see the detonator , Sir ?
You' ve got to cut it , Sir .
That frost won' t last .
Stop !
Stop !
Slow down !
Stop !
Stop !
Slow down !
- Go away !
- Yes , Sir .
- This is making me incredibly angry .
- I know , Sir .
Watch out !
That' il burn !
Ow !
Can you feel ' em ?
Cut it , Sir .
- You' ve gotta cut it !
- I don' t even know if this is the right wire .
Choose .
Just choose a wire and cut it .
Get a blanket !
Dade , get a blanket for Lieutenant !
Sarge !
Sarge !
It' s over , Sir !
It' s over !
- Jerry' s surrendered !
- Yeah- ha !
Sir , congratulations .
Heaven I' m in heaven
Kip ?
Kip ?
Kip !
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
Hey , we' re goin ' home !
When we' re out together dancing cheek to cheek
It' s raining .
And the cares that hung around me through the week
Seem to vanish like a gambler' s lucky streak
When we' re out together dancing cheek to cheek
Oh , I love to climb a mountain
And to reach the highest peak
But it doesn' t thrill me half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek
Kip , come and dance with us .
- Later .
- Oh , come on .
Clap now .
Yeah .
Here comes the bomb squad !
Hey , let me handle it !
Go on , Sergeant Hardy !
Bring ' em home !
Hardy !
Hardy !
Hardy !
What was that ?
I' m never going to forgive myself .
I' m never going to bloody forgive myself .
Sergeant Hardy , Sir .
It was booby- trapped .
They was runnin ' up the Union Jack , Sir , up on that statue .
It just went off , Sir .
Sergeant Hardy climbed up , Sir , just for a lark , Sir .
It should' ve been me .
It was my idea .
- Sir , you don' t wanna look .
- Ooh .
Who' s that girl ?
His fiancee , Sir .
- Hardy' s ?
- He kept it a bit dark .
Kip ?
Kip , it' s me .
I' m so sorry about what happened .
Can I talk to you ?
Kip ?
Kip , why won' t you talk to me ?
Oh , Kip .
Oh , let me come in !
Hana tells me you' re leaving .
There' s going to be trials .
They want me to interpret .
Don' t they know I' m allergic to courtrooms ?
So ...
I come across the hospital convoy .
They' re looking for this stuff .
This nurse , Mary , tells me about you and Hana ... hiding in some monastery in -
What do you call it ?
Retreat ?
How you came out of the desert ... and you were burned and you didn' t remember your name , but you knew the words to every song that ever was ... and you had one possession : a copy of Herodotus .
And it was filled ... with letters and cuttings .
Then I knew it was you .
Me ?
I saw you ... writing in that book at the embassy in Cairo ... when I had thumbs and you had a face ... and a name .
I see .
Before you went over to the Germans , before you found a way to get Rommel' s spy across the desert and inside British headquarters .
He took some pretty good photographs .
I saw mine in that torture room in Tobruk .
So , it made an impression .
I had to get back to the desert .
I' d made a promise .
The rest meant nothing to me .
What did you say ?
That the rest ... meant nothing to me .
There was a result to what you did .
It wasn' t just another expedition .
It did this .
If the British hadn' t unearthed that photographer , thousands of people could have died .
Thousands of people did die .
Just different people .
- Yes , like Madox .
- What ?
You know he shot himself , your partner ,
- when he found out you were a spy .
- What ?
Madox thought I was a spy ?
No .
No , I was never a spy .
It' s ghastly .
It' s like a witch hunt .
Anybody remotely foreign is suddenly a spy .
- So watch out .
- Right .
We didn' t care about countries , did we ?
Brits , Arabs , Hungarians , Germans -
None of that mattered , did it ?
It was something finer than that .
Yes , it was .
I' il leave the plane in Kufra oasis .
- So , if you need it - - Right .
Hard to know how long one' s talking about .
We might all be back in a month or two .
Hmm .
I have to teach myself not to read too much into everything .
It comes of too long having to read so much into hardly anything at all .
Goodbye , my friend .
There is no God .
But I hope someone looks after you .
In case you' re still wondering , this is called a suprasternal notch .
Come and visit us in Dorset when all this nonsense is over .
You' il never come to Dorset .
So , you didn' t know Madox shot himself .
No .
And you didn' t kill the Cliftons ?
Sh -
She -
She die -
She - I can' t .
Well , maybe I did .
Maybe I did .
I was packing up our base camp ... at the Cave of Swimmers .
Clifton had offered to fly down from Cairo to collect me .
He flew like a madman always , so I - I took no notice .
Aaah !
Katharine ?
Dear God , Katharine , what are you doing here ?
I can' t get out .
I can' t move .
" Surprise , " he said .
Poor Geoffrey .
He knew .
He must' ve known all the time .
He was shouting , " I love you , Katharine .
I love you so much . "
Is he badly hurt ?
I have to get you out .
- Please don' t move me .
- I have to get you out .
- It hurts too much .
- I know , darling , I know .
I' m sorry .
Come on .
Now !
Why did you hate me ?
What ?
Don' t you know you drove everybody mad ?
Shh .
Don' t talk .
You speak so many bloody languages ... and you never want to talk .
- You' re wearing the thimble .
- Of course .
You idiot .
I always wear it .
I' ve always worn it .
I' ve always loved you .
It' s so cold .
I know .
I' m sorry .
I' il make a fire .
Did you get Geoffrey out of the plane ?
- Yes , I did .
- Good .
That' s good .
Thank you .
Listen to me , Katharine .
You' ve broken your ankle ... and I' m going to have to try and bind it .
I think you' ve also broken your wrist ... and maybe some ribs , which is why it' s hurting you to breathe .
I' m going to have to walk to El Taj .
Although , given all the traffic in the desert these days ,
I' m bound to bump into one army or another .
And then I' il come back and you' il be fine .
You promise ?
I wouldn' t want to die here .
I don' t want to die in the desert .
I' ve always had a rather elaborate funeral in mind .
Particular hymns .
And I know exactly where I want to be buried .
In our garden , where I grew up ... with a view of the sea .
So promise me you' il come back for me .
I promise ...
I' il come back for you .
I promise ...
I' il never leave you .
You have plenty of water ... and , um , food .
I' il open them for you .
A good read .
Don' t waste this .
Will you bury Geoffrey ?
I know he' s dead .
I' m sorry , Katharine .
I know .
Every night ...
I cut out my heart .
But in the morning it was full again .
Darling .
My darling .
You' d better be ready about half past 8 : 00
Now , honey Don' t you be late
I' m going to be there when the band starts playing
Remember When we get there , honey
An invitation to the strutter' s ball
A very swell affair
All the highbrows will be there
I' il be down to get you in a taxi , honey
I stopped at noon and at twilight .
Three days there on foot , I told her , and three hours back by car .
Don' t go anywhere .
I' il be back .
I' il be back .
Just walked in from the desert , Sir .
Morning .
Dear golly , where have you come from then ?
There' s been an accident .
I need a doctor ... to come with me , and I need to borrow this car .
I' il pay , of course .
- And I need - I need morphine .
- May I see your papers , Sir ?
What ?
If I could just see some form of identification .
I' m sorry , I' m not making sense .
Forgive me , I - I' m not -
I' ve been walking and -
A woman is badly injured at the Gilf Kabir , the Cave of Swimmers .
I' m a member of the Royal Geographical Society .
Right .
Now , if I could ... just take your name .
Count Laszlo de Almasy .
" Almasy . " Would you mind spelling that for me ?
- Look , listen to me , will you ?
- What nationality would that be ?
A woman is dying .
My wife is dying .
I have been ... walking -
I have been walking for three days .
I do not want to spell my name .
- I want you to give me this car .
- I understand you' re agitated .
Perhaps if you' d like to sit down , I can radio back to HQ .
No .
No , don' t - Don' t radio anybody !
Just give me the fucking car !
Stop the car , please .
A woman is dying !
Listen , Fritz , if I have to listen to another word from you ,
I' m going to give you a fucking good hiding !
Fritz ?
What are you talking about , Fritz ?
Well , that' s your name , isn' t it ?
Count Fuckin ' Asshole Von Bismarck !
- What' s that supposed to be , Irish ?
- Please !
You have to listen !
Katharine !
Katharine !
Excuse me .
- I also need to use the lavatory .
- You' il have to wait .
- It' s urgent .
- Sarge !
Sarge , Jerry wants to use the lav .
Says it' s urgent .
- Where are we going , please ?
- Oh , up north to the coast .
Benghazi .
Soon be there .
You can get your boat back home then .
All right , go on then .
Here , you take him .
I' ve been up and down this bloody train all day .
It doesn' t open .
Aaah !
So yes , she died because of me .
Because I loved her .
Because I -
Because I had the wrong name .
- And you never got back to the cave ?
- I did get back .
I kept my promise .
I was assisted by the Germans .
There was a - a trade .
I had our expedition maps .
And after the British made me their enemy ,
I gave their enemy our maps .
So I got back to the desert ... and to Katharine ... in Madox' s English plane ... with German gasoline .
When I arrived in Italy , on my medical chart they wrote ,
" English Patient . "
Isn' t that funny ?
After all that , I became English .
You get to the morning and the poison leaks away , doesn' t it ?
Black nights .
- I thought I would kill you .
- You can' t kill me .
I died years ago .
No , I can' t kill you now .
We' ve been posted .
North of Florence .
I was thinking yesterday - yesterday -
The patient and Hardy .
They' re everything that' s good about England .
I couldn' t even say what that was .
We didn' t exchange two personal words , and we' ve been together through some terrible things .
Some terrible things .
He was engaged to a girl in the village .
I mean -
And us , he never once -
He didn' t ask me if I could spin the ball at cricket or kama sutra or -
I don' t even know what I' m talking about .
You loved him .
Katharine .
I' m still here .
You' d better be .
Don' t depend on it , will you ?
That little bit of air in my lungs , each day it gets less and less .
Which is all right .
It' s quite all right .
I' ve been speaking to Caravaggio , my research assistant .
He tells me there' s a ghost in the cloisters .
I can join him .
- Hana !
- It' s the boy .
I' il always go back to that church .
Look at my paintings .
I' il always go back to that church .
So one day we' il meet .
Thank you .
Read to me , will you ?
Read me to sleep .
" My darling ,
" I' m waiting for you .
" How long is a day in the dark ?
" Or a week ?
" The fire is gone now ... and I' m horr - horribly cold . "
I really ought to drag myself outside , but then there' d be the sun .
I' m afraid I waste the light ... on the paintings and on writing these words .
We die .
" We die .
" We die rich with lovers and tribes ,
" tastes we have swallowed ,
" bodies we have entered ... and swum up like rivers . "
Fears we' ve hidden in ,
like this wretched cave .
I want all this marked on my body .
We' re the real countries .
Not the boundaries drawn on maps , the names of powerful men .
I know you' il come and carry me out into the palace of winds .
That' s all I' ve wanted , to walk in such a place with you , with friends .
An Earth without maps .
" The lamp' s gone out ,
" and I' m writing ... in the darkness . "
Hana ?
Hana , come on !
Hana , this is Gioia .
- Buon giorno .
- Buon giorno .
She' il take you as far as Florence .
I can get in back .
