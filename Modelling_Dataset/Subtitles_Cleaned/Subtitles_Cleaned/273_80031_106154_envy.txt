Lula loves her syrup .
- [ Debbie ]
You have enough syrup .
[ Tim ]
Mrs. Butterworths isn' t a squirt bottle .
Lt' s no big deal .
You' ve had enough .
- Mom , these aren' t brown enough .
- Do you want me to burn them ?
No , but I just want them more brown .
Mikey , Mom' s not a short order cook .
Eat up now .
Double knots ?
We never did double knots .
- [ Nick ]
Sweetie , I can' t get it .
- Don' t use a fork .
No bubbles at the table .
Eat your breakfast first .
She' s right , you know , my eggs taste like bubbles now .
- Hurry up , honey , you' il be late .
- [ Tim ]
All right .
The van needs an inspection sticker .
Good luck .
Alrighty .
What' s this ?
Look who' s hiding .
Mr. Dino ... and another weird stowaway .
Okay , Nathan , no cereal in my thingie .
- Bye , sweetheart .
- Bye , honey .
Nathan !
- What' s that ?
- What ?
That .
Maple syrup .
Mmm , man !
Can you believe that comes from a tree ?
Don' t taste my pants .
L can' t taste your pants ?
Ever .
- Ever ?
- No .
Well , don' t spill maple syrup on them .
Just because it' s there doesn' t mean you have to taste it .
- I like maple syrup .
- Not from my pants .
L love it .
How about this :
What if you had , like , an inkpad ...
Only instead of ink , it was soaked in maple syrup .
Or peppermint .
Any flavor you wanted .
- And you just open up your little pad .
- Right .
And you press your finger on it and then you taste your finger .
Peppermint .
Any time of day .
Or cherry .
[ Tim ]
Wouldn' t the pad get disgusting after awhile ?
[ Nick ]
Disgusting how ?
L don' t know .
You keep touching it with your filthy fingers .
Couple of days that flavor pad' s like some mattress you find at the dump .
You' re right .
It' s no good .
[ knocking ]
[ Nick ]
Tim .
- Did you get your performance chart ?
- Yeah .
Well , look at mine .
I don' t get it .
Good .
Fair .
Fair .
Good .
Then it falls into the red in the focus department .
Well , you know , Nick , that' s because you' re a dreamer .
You know ?
- I' m not a dreamer .
- You' re not the most focused person .
You' re a dreamer .
Yeah .
I' m a dreamer ?
Hey , you want to feel something ?
Come here .
Sit in this chair .
Come here .
Okay .
Check this out .
Whoa .
- Sit back .
- Oh , this is some chair !
- Do you like it ?

Feel this .
What is that ?
- Lumbar support .
- That is good .
- It' s made especially for your spine .
- I like it .
Comes with the office .
And the promotion .
- Right .
- Thinking of buying a swimming pool ?
- What , are you kidding ?
- I am .
- Thinking bean- shaped .
Expensive .
Bean- shaped ?
Take a look at my performance chart .
Look at your focus .
It' s way up there .
It' s in the yellow .
L' m telling you , you get your focus even into the orange , just the orange ...
L guarantee you can have a chair like that .
- Really ?
- And an office like this .
And a piano- shaped pool if that' s what you want .
Lt' s all there for you .
All you got to do is focus .
Just work a little bit harder .
You can get bumped up to sandpaper with me and the world opens up .
You know what , man ?
You could really sack out in this thing .
L' m telling you , your numbers aren' t that bad .
It' s just focus .
Lf you put together everything else , you got a really strong thing going on ...
Nick .
Nick !
- I got to get back to work .
- Yeah .
- Good talk .
- Yeah , good talk .
- Remember what I said .
- Focus .
- Just get into orange .
- That' s all I need .
Don' t even worry about yellow , just orange .
[ Nick ]
Do you ever just watch your hand ?
[ Tim ]
No .
L was just looking at my hand today .
Lt was like a separate thing .
Lt was ...
Picking up papers .
Lt tapped on my desk .
It sat in my lap .
- It' s like ...
- Sorry .
Lt' s like a ...
Lt' s like a sidekick .
My little ugly sidekick .
It was very odd .
Eww .
- [ Nick ]
Oh , oh !
- [ Tim ]
What ?
- [ Nick ]
Oh !
- [ Tim ]
What ? !
[ Nick ]
How about this ?
A spray can , see ?
And you spray it on dog poo ...
And the poo disappears .
- Disappears ?
- Yes !
Where does it go ?
Who knows ?
But the thing is ...
You come up with something that gets rid of dog turds ,
You are home free , my friend .
Home free .
What ?
Nothing .
Liposuction .
You mean , where they suck the fat out ?
There' s a thing about it in here .
You' re fine .
You don' t need to get fat sucked out .
- lf we had a little extra money ...
- We don' t have extra money .
- We have a little .
- Not to get fat sucked out .
Hello ?
- Timmy .
Timmy , check this out .
- What ?
You know that invention of mine that makes turds disappear ?
L got a name for it .
Vapoorize .
Just like vaporize only you add an " o " so you got " poo " right in the middle .
Yeah , I get it .
Do you see how perfect it is ?
Maybe even underline the poo .
Va- poo- rize .
- All right .
- Vapoorize .
Goodbye .
- Nick ?
- Mmm- hmm .
- What did he want ?
- Nothing .
Vapoorize .

Lt' s a spray can and you spray it on .

Hey , I have an invention .

Three months of rehearsal .

Anyway , I' m super excited ...
Because we are so lucky ...
And we have so , so , so much .
And I feel like we should give something back .
So , I' ve decided I' m going to run for Congress
Or state senate or whatever .
And my main platform ...
Is going to be ...
The environment .
State senate .
Environment , like the whole environment ?
Yeah .
I believe in all environments and I' m going to say it .
And now for dessert .

Boy , that flan was good .
L wish we had flan .
Dad ?
Yeah ?
Why are we getting the little , itty- bitty pool ?
Lt' s not a little itty- bitty .
The square one' s little itty- bitty .
We' re getting the bean- shaped model .
A little itty- bitty bean .
Lt' s not a little , itty- bitty bean .
It' s an average- sized bean , Mikey .
And I got news for you .
There are kids in the world who' d walk 50 miles through quicksand
Just to stick a toe in your pool .
And I got news for you about beans too .
Some kids' d eat beans because they' ve had nothing to eat their whole life ,
But leaves and bark and roots .
And I guarantee you , none of them has ever heard of your big , show- off flan ,
Or flan or whatever you want to call it that you got to have every night .
Two thousand dollars .
That' s all it would' ve taken .
- It' s okay , honey .
- Dad' s just having a meltdown .
Good night .
Sleep tight .

L don' t want any more cereal .
Eat up , otherwise you don' t get to play with Corky , okay ?

Why are you always asking " what " ?

- Yes , you are .
Lt' s true , Dad , you are .
Well , because I know there' s something .

Corky !
So beautiful .
[ Mikey ]
Such a great horse , Corky .
[ Mikey ]
Who' s a good boy ?
Corky' s a sweet and gentle horse and me and the kids love him .
Corky happens to shit the size of a breadbasket
In our yard every day when he comes to visit .
What are you doing ?
Nothing .
Nothing at all .
L' m just throwing away some more completely useless inventions .
For chrissakes , Debbie , light ?
Light ? !
Come on !
Come on !
This was shit .
You think Edison would' ve looked up from his workbench at some shit spray ?
Yes .
Yes , I do .
Because , you see , a good invention is a good invention !
L got news for you , sister .
Edison ain' t looking up .
Sister .
Sister ? !

You should be so lucky to be my sister .
She knows what she' s talking about .

Have you been stealing apples again , you little rascal ?
Listen , and I want you to be honest , has Corky become a nuisance ?
- No .

Natalie says , " Keep the corral closed . "
But Corky' s so crazy about your apples , I don' t know what to do .
No more apples for you .
No more apples ...
L can' t stop him .
He loves your apples .
Are you sure he' s not a problem ?
- Positive .

L got something for you .
I' il be right back .

Please .

You' il love it .
You don' t have to get me anything else .
[ Nick ]
When I hit it big ,
Everyone said I should buy a house in Beverly Hills , Bel Air or Malibu .
" Why you spending money on a mansion in the Valley ? "
But I love my neighborhood , and being across the street from my best friend .
Do you see how it moves in the wind ?
That' s what I love .
Lt flaps different than cheaper fabric .
Do you notice that ?
- Yeah .
- And it makes you feel better .
Nice fabric makes you feel better !
It' s mind- blowing , isn' t it ?
Nick , you buy us too much .
Too much ? !
You' re my best friend .
Nice things make life nicer .
All right , let' s take another look at that follow- through .
L want the head down .
That is nice , Nicky .
- Right ?
- Very nice .
God Almighty , Mr. Dingman .
Nick ?
Can I talk to you for a second ?
Just take a second .
Can' t it just be us ?
You and me playing golf ?
Lt' s just , this is costing a fortune .
Cut it out with this money thing .
It means nothing to me .
Let' s just enjoy it .
Why can' t you come with us ?
Because Daddy has to go to work .
You' il have a great time at Aunt Nancy' s .
Aunt Windsong , and you know that .
Lt' s Aunt Windsong now .
Honey , you don' t have to do this .
Really .
Why do this ?
Because I have to do this .
We have to do this .
Something has to change .
L can' t look at you , I can' t look across the street .
L' m running out of places to look .
The pool people come tomorrow .
[ Nathan ]
Just wait and see this , Dad .
Whoa !

You wanted to see me ?
You all right ?

You seem distracted !
- What ?
- Come on !
[ Parmenter ]
Your performance chart' s pretty good until here .
And then your focus nosedives into the red .
You see ?
Now , is there anything that happened around here ...
You might like to talk about ?
No .
- You sure ?
- Yeah .
No .
Any reason ?
Reason ?
No , I can' t think of ...
Any reason at all ?
No .
No reason .
No .
I mean , nothing I can think of .
L mean ...
You know , other than every day I get into my little shit- box car
And there he is , with the wind in his hair ...
On his great big shiny horse .
And I drive off to do what ?
To make sandpaper .
To make paper with sand on it .
L' d love to see you try to turn your weasely little mouth into a fake smile ,
Day after day after day ...
While waving toodly- fucking- do to your best friend ,
Who' s rearing up on a big white horse like he' s the Lone Ranger .
Then I' d like to see your performance chart ,
You beady- eyed little shrimp- boat bastard !
Ls that a reason ?
L mean , is that a reason ?
Hi .
L don' t really drink , but my family just left me
And I got fired and I want a drink .
So , if you could just give me whatever you' d have if you wanted to drink .
Please .
[ man ]
Harsh .
Abandoned .
Fired .
Lt' s harsh , man .
Know what the best job I ever got fired from was ?
Pretzel kiosk .
Afternoon shift .
Just loved it , don' t know why , just did .
Could be the apron , who the hell knows ?
Or maybe the feeling of power you get when there' s a crowd .
One hand rolls dough , ties those babies off .
The other hand maybe works the soda , refills the mustard .
It' s quite a thing .
L' il tell you a secret .
Lf a pretzel is a quality pretzel , you don' t need salt .
Lt' s just a fact .
[ man ]
How come ?
Your family up and blew out of town on you ?
Thank you , but I don' t really feel like talking about it right now .

Or the kid that stole a chicken with the golden eggs .
What a fantastic chicken .
Who' s for the giant ?
Nobody .
You hear what I' m saying .
You' re the hero .
Forget Che !
You' re like Robin Hood .

Really ?
- Listen to me .
Listen to me .
Life' s unfair .
It' s a raw deal planet , Jack .
You , my little dumbbell friend , are Mr. Everyman
And you don' t even know it , which makes you like the grand turbo Mr. Everyman .
Honestly ?
Come on .
You' re like a great big dimwit .
You know that .
Fantastic .
Everyman Dimwit .
That stinking family across the street .
Who wouldn' t feel like you ?
L like you .
I' m glad I came in here .
You know that ?
Ringlets !
Give me a break .
Let me tell you a little story .
When I was maybe 1 0 ,
There was this kid across the street , Ernie " Nice Kid . "
Ernie had everything .
Only kid around with a BB gun , okay ?
So one night I see the whole family drive off .
What' d I do ?
I sneak across the street and find the BB gun .
L squeeze off maybe five , ten pot shots at the windows ...
Hello . ln my house .
- ln your house ?
- Yes , you got ...
You squoze off to your house ?
You got it .
Next morning my old man gets up ,
Sees all these little BB holes in our windows .
He marches across the street , bangs on the door and Tim ,
My little bozo friend ,
Things changed big time over there in Ernieville .
That' s what you got to do !
- What ?
- Shake things up .
Over there , man .
Shake them up .
Make them think of something besides the temperature in that candy- ass pool .
- Shit , what time is it ?
- What kind of question is that ?
L got to get back !
They can' t build the pool !
Lke , cab ...
On the J- Man .

Excuse me !

Good afternoon , Mr. Tim .

And here is something from your great friends across the street
While your wonderful family is away .
" Thought you might enjoy a taste from our newly acquired vineyard . "
[ J- Man ]
You got to shake things up .
Over there , man .

Carousel of dreams .
Casa Corky .

[ J- Man ]
You got to shake things up .
Over there , man .
Shake them up .
Shake things up .

Huh ?
Corky .
My God .
How is this possible ?
How could a little arrow kill a big horse ?
Come on , Corky .
Corky , come on , come on .
Lt' s just a little arrow .
Come on , Corky .
Giddy up , boy .
Corky .
Giddy up .

Hey .
Cock- a- doodle- doo .
Car return .
How' s that for service ?
L' d probably still be driving a limo if it wasn' t for the hat .
Hats .
Hats make my head itch .
- What time is it ?
- You got a time hang- up , don' t you ?
Oh , God .
- Look at me .
- I was thinking the same thing .
You are one big stinking pig , Tim .
- How' d you get my keys ?
- Keys ?
The J- Man don' t usually need keys , my little dumbbell pal .
So , that' s the place ?
Look at it .
All from shit ?
I see what you mean .
L don' t even live here and that place is pulling my testicles up .
L mean , literally , they' re actually coming up .
You ever get that ?
L killed his horse .
- What ?
- I killed his horse .
That story you were telling about shaking things up ...
L went over there and I shot this bow and arrow ,
And I shot at my house and I hit his horse .
He was eating apples in my yard .
There was a hole because we were going to have a pool and I buried him in it .
- Well , now .
Daddy !
We' re home !
No !
Lt' s my family .
- Hide !
- Hide ?
Hide !
Hide .

Can' t I just mosey off ?

Don' t mosey off .
No , you can' t mosey off .
They' il see you !

So , what are you doing here ?
Who are you ?
You' re some guy from a bar .
What' s wrong with ... ?
I' m the J- Man , bringing your car back .
Daddy !
- Hey , tiger !
- Daddy !
- Hey , peanut .
- We all really missed you .
You look terrible .
Honey , one question .
What is at the heart of everything ?
What I' m asking you is :
What is at the heart of the heart of the heart of the heart ?
Do you know what the answer is ?
Self- love .
Windsong told me that I have been hating myself for resenting you .
And you' ve been resenting yourself for passing up on a big opportunity .
What we need to do is we need to focus on what we have .
Hey !
Oh , hey !
This is ...
This guy ...
Honey ...
This is ...
This man is the man ...
Who was in the bathroom .
I didn' t tell you .
Honey ... something happened while you were gone , something bad .
What ?
L' il take it from here , Tim .
Mrs. Dingman ...
L' m Elmo Carp , pool rep .
Your husband and I were up here discussing your swimming pool options .
- Swimming pool options ?
- Yes .
You see , we dug it , we had to fill it back in .
We' re sorry as heck .
Where do we go from here ?
That' s the point we were at when you barged in .
L don' t understand .
Fill it back in ?
So you mean we' re not getting a pool ?
No , sonny boy , I' m afraid not .
Too many gosh darn pipes .
- Pipes ?
- Yes .
Underground pipes in your yard ,
But I' ve intruded enough on your little family reunion here .
L' il be on my way .
And thanks for filthying up your clothes ,
Helping me fill in the big hole , Tim .
Ma' am , your husband' s got the back of a coal miner .
L know because I' ve mined coal .
See you .
Something' s happened to Corky .
- What ?
- [ kids ]
Corky ?
- Have you seen Corky ?
- I haven' t seen Corky .
- Corky' s gone ?
- Have you seen Corky ?
- I have not seen Corky .
- That' s what I mean .
We' ve been looking and looking .
Where could he be ?
- A great big horse , where ?
- Nick , a horse can' t just disappear .
- He' s got to be somewhere .
- Yeah , but where ?
Where ?
Where ?
The kids are a mess .
Wish me luck .
Corky !
[ Nick ]
Corky , come on !
Good afternoon .
My name is Natalie Vanderpark .
L' m running for state senate in your district .
So I thought I' d canvass the neighborhood
And introduce myself to everyone .
Who it is , Mable ?
Lt' s that woman running for state senate , Carl .
The shit lady ?
No way .
We' re going with Shaunessey .
Your opponent Shaunessey ,
He asked a good question on the radio this morning .
And what question was that ?
Well , didn' t your husband get loaded making turds disappear ?
My husband invented Vapoorize , if that' s what you' re referring to .
That' s what Shaunessey was talking about .
Where do all them turds go ?
I mean , they got to be somewhere .
First they' re here , then they' re not here ,
And then they disappear .
Where does the turd go to ?
Really , tell me now .
So long , everybody .
- Bye , have a good day at work .
- Bye , Daddy .
- Bye , honey .
- Good luck at the salt mines , Dad .
Where am I going ?
Wait .
Timmy , wait !
Wait !
God .
Timmy , I can' t find him .
L' ve been looking all night and he' s nowhere .
L know he' s just a horse , but ...
Corky .
Corky !
Where are you , my Corky boy ?
God , look at me .
This is crazy .
Will you pass these out down at 3M for me ?
L found some grooming hairs in his tail brush .
My God . - $50, 000 ?
It' s pennies !
Lt' s pennies .
Who cares ?
Corky' s my pal .
He' s my pal and I' d pay $50, 000 to find you if you were lost , wouldn' t l ?
- Yeah .
- Wouldn' t l ? !
- Okay .
All right .
It' s going to be okay .
All right .
It' s going to be okay .
Are you insane ?
That is the most selfish thing I ever heard in my life .
The guy loves you , man .
You' d be killing your best friend .
You killed his horse , right ?
You killed his horse .
Now you want to tell him ?
You tell him .
What about this ?
We move the horse someplace else .
L find it , I get the reward .
I' m bending over backwards here .
How do we move a horse ?
We dig him up .
We haul him off .
No , I mean ... without anybody seeing us .
You ever hear of night ?
What about the noise ?
My family' s right there .
L don' t want them to ...
You don' t move the horse , I do ,
While you and your family are enjoying nature ,
Down at my cabin on the lake .
- You have a cabin on the lake ?
- What ?
You think I didn' t have a childhood ?
Bunk beds , hiking trails , hooty owls .
You can move a horse by yourself ?
For 50 grand .
But I will say this :
Knowing what I happen to know about things buried ,
The sooner the better .
- [ Tim ]
Hey , Deb ?
- [ Debbie ]
Mmm- hmm ?
How' d you like to go to a nice cabin on a lake ?
- Cabin on a lake ?
- Yeah .
This guy at work offered his cabin .
It' s supposed to be really nice .
- Who at work offered you this ?
- Jackameyer .
Jack ...
Jack Jackameyer .
[ Tim ]
It' s an hour from here and it has all sorts of wildlife ...
And hooty owls and stuff .
[ Tim ]
Hiking trails .
[ protestors ]
Where does the shit go ?
We want to know !
Where does the shit go ?
We want to know !
Where does the shit go ?
We want to know !
Pretty incredible , huh ?
Whoa !
Watch out .
It' s okay .
What a spot .
What do you mean , " what a spot " ?
I mean , where ...
He said it' s just down at the end of the private driveway .
What private driveway ?
This isn' t a private driveway .
This is pretty private , honey .
I mean , this is great .
Talk about secluded .
We' ve walked , like , a mile .
Lt' s not a mile , honey .
It seems longer because it' s so beautiful .
Tim !
Mommy , where' s Daddy ?
- I don' t know , honey .
L' m thirsty .
- Okay .
- Tim !
- Whoo !
I found it !
Lt' s a little sloping incline down to the ...
This is it ?
You bet this is it .
This is ...
This is wild , huh , kids ?
Kind of like a ...
Like an old gingerbread house in the woods .
Where' s the lake ?
L' il tell you what .
Why don' t we check out the bunkhouse , okay ?
And then you guys can have a contest to see who finds the lake first , all right ?
Winner gets 50 cents .
50 cents .
Come on .
Let' s check it out .
Okay .
Weird smell .
Let' s hold our noses .
Come on .
Lt' s okay , Mikey , come on in .
- My God .
- It' s okay .
Just a little critter .
Just ...
Don' t touch it .
He' s dead .
Under no circumstances is this a lake .
Maybe there' s a tide .
No one could ever find this lake .
Congratulations , you saved yourself 50 cents .
What is that ?
Tim ?
Yes ?
Tim ?
Yes ?
You' re Tim ?
Yes , I' m Tim .
The J- Man says , " Come quick . "
Come quick ?
Yeah , come quick .
That' s it .
Now , when you see the J- Man , you tell him we' re even .
And Bosco says , " Up your ass with Mobil gas . "
Okay .
What will you tell the J- Man ?
L' m going to tell him that Bosco says we' re even
And up your ass with Mobil gas .
Mobil gas .
Lt' s Jack' s neighbor , he needs some help .
Neighbor ?
That' s right , Bosco , he' s as nice as Jack ,
But his car' s stuck so I' m going to help him , okay ?
L didn' t see any neighbors .
What ?
You think Bosco would lie ?
Why would Bosco lie ?
I' il go get him right now if you want .
Okay .
- Okay ?
- Yes .
Yes , I' d like to ask him about this hellhole .
L don' t want to bring him in .
He' s big .
- You know , the floorboards .
- How big ?
- How big ?
- Yes .
Big .
He' s like a bear of a guy with , like , a little head .
L don' t know what that means .
Look , I' m going to go help this guy
Because Windsong would sure as hell help this guy .
Okay ?
L' m going to be back .
Just go back to sleep , okay ?
- What' s wrong ?
- It' s for you .
Don' t hassle me about crumbs , man ,
Because I am on the edge of the edge .
Hello ?
[ Nick ]
Natalie stormed out of the bedroom .
We had a terrible fight .
You got to come over here now .
I know you got your Army pal over there .
I didn' t know you were in the Army .
If I can come over ...
No , I' il come there .
- Okay , good .
Thanks .
- No , no , no .
I' il come over .
[ Tim ]
I' il come there .
Here I come .
L got to go across the street for a second .
That is incorrect .
Follow me .
This was no picnic , let me tell you .
L had an ' 88 Ford flatbed
All lined up with a brand- new winch ,
But I fried it during the hot- wire , goddamn it .
Good thing Monk passed out , or I' d never got this baby .
Whoa .
What in the shit is this ?
What is it ?
Lt' s winches , hoists , pulleys , blocks and tackles .
This kind of thing .
You know how I got the idea ?
You know those big things on Easter lsland ?
- Easter lsland ?
- Huh ?
Easter lsland ?
With this device , I can place that horse on top of any object .
That truck' s too high .
You won' t get the horse in there .
You' re like a specially trained super agent .
You know that ?
Why do you think I called you ?
I was so pissed off .
L nearly climbed back into your house and smashed some plates .
Stand warned , okay , stand warned .
L have to go over there for a minute or you don' t get your money .
- Do you want your money ?
- Yes .
Then put that horse on top of my van .
There' s rope and tarp in the garage .
- Put the horse on the van ?
- Put the horse on the van .
- Rope .
- Yeah , and be quiet .
Lt' s simple , okay ?
- All right ?
I' il be right back .
- Yeah .
Hello , Mr. Tim .
You' re looking very sprightly for the hour .
We go up the stairs , please .
Right this way .
L' ve never been in this part .
They are practicing for the tournament .
Come on !
Yes !
Who' s your nanny ? !
Hey .
[ Nick ]
Come .
Come here .
Right here , come on .
You' re incredible , do you know that ?
You' re an incredible friend .
- What the hell was that ?
- They' re bowling next door .
Getting ready for your tournament .
They' re hitting strikes .
- She' s been blaming me for Corky .
- Who ?
Natalie , she just kept blaming me for Corky and making me feel guilty .
Then she starts up with the shit thing .
How do I know where the shit goes ? !
Then I tell her , " I' m going to Rome tomorrow , " and she freaks out !
She has a complete flip out !
She flips out the room !
- Where' d she go ?
- I don' t know .
- Some other wing .
But , buddy ... this ltaly thing is huge .
Lt could seriously ...
It could mean literally billions .
You know what I think this is ?
I think you just got to get some sleep .
You got to shut everything down .
Get under the covers .
Come on .
Get under the covers .
Don' t listen to anything .
- Sometimes you think you hear things ...
- You' re a great friend .
Sleep and it' s going to be different and don' t wake up .
Okay ?
[ J- Man ] ~ Valderi ~ Valdera ~ Valderi ~ Valdera ha ha ha ... ~ Valderi
Et cetera .
What about here ?
Right here ?
You kidding ?
There' s towns around .
You want somebody else finding my horse ?
There' il be towns everywhere .
Hey , six months I drove a yogurt truck , okay ?
This is my territory , Jack .
What do you got up there ?
A sofa .
What kind of sofa ?
Homemade .
- Oh , my God .
What is this ?
- Troopers .
Oh , no .
The bridge is out .
Follow the detour along the river to the next bridge , all right ?
Thank you very much .
- Have a good night .
- Let' s go .
He didn' t notice the horse .
Smokey didn' t even notice that we got a horse on the roof .
- I can' t believe he didn' t see it .
- [ J- Man ]
Dumb Smokey .
- [ Tim ]
How about right here ?
- No , it' s not good .
- What' s wrong with here ?
- It doesn' t feel right .
L hope it' s very soon .
L got to be back there .
It' s going to be light out .
They' re asleep and don' t know you left .
I' m doing you a favor doing this .
How about here ?
What' s wrong with here ?
L dig up the horse , I haul it up , I invent everything .
Why do we have to do what you want to do ?
- Corky' s new home .
- This is not good for me .
Forget it .
This is it , right here .
Okay ?
[ J- Man ]
Bad vibe .
[ Tim ]
Oh , no !
He' s gone !
Where' d he go ? !
Did you hear anything ?
Like a thump ?
Where did he go ?
Shit !
- [ Tim ]
Did you check the knots ?
- [ J- Man ]
Knots ?
Who knows knots ?
- Not you .
- You know , I' m not Popeye .
How did we not hear ?
How do you not hear a horse fall off a car ?
Maybe he' s not dead .
Maybe he ran away .
Lt' s raining so hard , the horse might have fallen off
And floated , who knows , into a ditch .
There' s a river that runs along this road .
He could be in it .
Corky could be heading for the open sea .
My God , honey .
What time is it ?
Lt' s okay .
Go back to sleep .
Yeah ?
Did you solve the problem ?
- Yeah .
- Yeah ?
Actually ...
L think I did .
[ Tim ] ~ Gonna be a bright Bright sunshiny day
Whoo ! ~ Gonna be a bright Bright sunshiny day
- Timmy !
Telephone !
Good morning , Mr. Tim .
L must say ...
You' re looking fit as a fiddle this morning , Mr. Tim .
Thanks .
I hear Mr. Nick wants to see me .
Yes , I know .
He' s running in the woods .
L talked to the guys over at 3M .
I know you got canned .
You' ve met Pete , right ?
My trainer .
Don' t feel funny around Pete .
I got no secrets from Pete .
- Do I , Pete ?
- I don' t think so .
So here' s the deal :
Buddy boy ...
That my little hearty hi- ho Silver routine
Affected you like that , all I can say is , I am such a jerk .
But it' s the best thing that ever happened ,
Because now I' il go kick ass in Rome .
And guess what ?
You , you unemployed bum , you' il come kick ass with me .
L want us to be partners .
L want us to be equal again , man .
Why not ?
I mean , for crying out loud , I' ve got a Pete .
Why shouldn' t you have a Pete ?
Who wouldn' t like having a Pete ?
So this is the deal .
From now on , you and me , 50l50 .
- 50l50 ?
- That' s right .
50l50 .
L' il talk to my lawyer .
Why didn' t I think of it sooner ?
It' s awesome !
Get the hell out of here , the limo leaves in an hour and a half !
Buddy boy !
Let' s go , buddy boy !
All right .
Come on .
Now , pump it up .
I want full cardio blast now .
- Let' s go .
- Don' t be shy .
There you go .
No , keep going !
Keep it there !
Crampers .
- You all right ?
- Crampers .
L don' t know , honey .
Do you want to do this ?
L mean , do we want to be part of the shit industry ?
What about the heart of the heart of the heart of the heart ?
L don' t think this conflicts with that .
I mean , you know , there' s ...
Lt' s a lot of money and the heart of the heart , and they' re both ...
Still have the heart with a lot of money .
- I think .
You know .
- You know what I think ?
L think I know what we should do .
We should just try it .
- Try it !
- Yes .
- Try it .
- Try it .
Try it .
- Try it .
See how it feels .
- Try it .
Oh , my God , I can' t believe it !
- Bye , Daddy .
- We' il miss you .
- We miss you already .
- I' il be home soon .
Good to see you , captain .
You know what I was thinking ?
We should target zoos .
Thank you , Denise .
Zoos ?
Yeah , zoos .
I mean , come on , they' re full of poop .
L popped on the lnternet just before we got on the plane .
Did you know that an elephant goes , like 1 00 pounds a day ?
Times that by seven , that' s 700 pounds of dung a week for one elephant .
There' s got to be thousands of zoos in the world .
That is really very good .
Zoos .
- I got another one for you .
- [ Nick ]
Yeah ?
Travel industry .
We get into the travel industry .
L' m talking about little travel- size Vapoorize .
You mean , like the cute little shampoo bottles ?
- Exactly .
- My God , that' s so simple and awesome !
You' re on a trip .
You' re walking through Venice .
You step in some dog doo .
So , what do you do ?
- You take out a travel- size Vapoorize .
- That' s it !
A little Velcro holster you put on your belt .
Right next to your cell phone , your pager , your Vapoorize .
You can walk the dog handsfree and not worry about the Vapoorize .
L love a holster .
- Accessorize with Vapoorize .
- Hold on .
Hold on .
Let me take it from here . ~ You' re walkin ' along ~ A- doodley doo ~ All of a sudden You stepped in poo ! ~ You don' t know what to do
- What do you do ?
- I don' t know what to do .
~ Vapoorize , Vapoorize
- ~ Mountain- scented Vapoorize - ~ doogah- doogah- doogah Vapoorize
- What is the doogah ?
- I thought there would be drums .
- What is the doogah ?
- I thought there would be drums .
[ Nick ]
Come on .
Look at this place .
Go check out your bedroom .
Whoo !
Wow .
Vapoorize .
Shopping .
Gucci .
Here .
This' il look great in the yard next to the bug tent .
Definitely .
We' il take it .
It' s great .
Pay the man .
Lt makes the whole house .
It makes the yard .
With the sound .
With the sound .
It' s ridiculous , but that' s what I love about it .
L like this . ... with the Dow off 1 1 and the NASDAQ up five and a half .
A rather sluggish day on Wall Street .
On the international front , investors are watching Vanderpark Enterprises .
CEO , Nicholas Vanderpark and newly appointed partner , Tim Dingman ...
Arrive in Italy to introduce to Europe
Their complete line of fecal- removing product that' s been so successful here .
The American entrepreneurs have reason to be hopeful .
They were greeted with great enthusiasm everywhere and fanfare .
Later , they' il be feted at a banquet to be held in the presidential palace .
He says , " I noticed when we climbed into the tub
" our three penises were quite similar in size and bulk . "
He say , " And I thought to myself ,
" ' Good .
Good . " '
Envy is a funny , funny thing .
He says , " I remember when I was a teenager ,
" my friend Armando and I spent the summer in New York .
" A sweet time of life . "
The minister , he says ,
" I must tell you , my friend Armando had a hog like a freight train . "
What a hog .
He says , " And I must tell you secretly ,
" Armando' s freight- train- sized manhood
" made me , with a regular- size one , quite miserable . "
" Not all the time miserable , of course , but sometimes . "
This call has been transferred to you .
Thank you .
Hello ?
Turbo Everyman , my ass .
Where do you get off at ?
I bought you drinks .
You vacation in my bungalow and now you go jump ship .
Screw Robin Hood , you hear me ?
Screw the Merry Men .
You' re a stinko pinko .
Turncoat !
Here' s what I do , Mr. Traitor .
Remember Lester ?
He pumped our gas when we moved the sofa .
Not a tooth in his head , nice fella .
- Remember him now ?
- I do .
Yes .
Good .
For $50, 000 Lester keeps thinking it' s a sofa .
And me and him don' t spill the beans
To your hoity- toity pal across the street .
Let' s be very clear on this :
I want $50, 000 ...
Or I tell your friend you killed his horse .
Debbie ?
Deb , I' m home .
Sweetheart , I' ve been liposucked .
Can you tell ?
Can you ?
Does it look good ?
Dr. Weitzman is supposed to be a genius and it didn' t even really hurt .
And that is not all .
Come .
I am so excited .
Here' s a little gift I bought for us .
A little 50l50 surprise .
- My big international partner .
- Debbie .
- Let' s do it on the laundry .
- Where are the kids ? !
At Mother' s , honey .
It' s just us .
Come lie on the warm pile .
It' s all clean out of the dryer .
L will lie with you after I tell you something important .
L got drunk and by mistake killed Corky .
I buried him in the swimming pool hole .
The pool guy , he' s actually some bum I met at a bar .
Nick ?
Where does it go ?
What ?
The shit .
- Where does the shit go ?
- Up .
Up is not good enough .
You' il have to do better than up .
- Up ... and out .
- Out where ? !
Up and out .
Out .
Up and out .
- Up and out ?
- Up and out .
The bum wants $50, 000 or he' il tell Nick .
- Then we won' t get a chance to be rich .
Oh , my God .
Yes !
Go and pay the bum .
- Go pay the bum now .
- Go pay the bum ? !
- Honey , I love you .
- I love you too .
- Bye .
- Oh !
What ?
You don' t know this guy .
He' s not like other people , he' s ...
What if we pay him and then he wants more ?
Then we will give him more .
What if he wants more again ? !
We' il give him more money because we' il have enough money to give him .
But it' il never end with him .
He' il be in our lives forever .
Tim , if he tells Nick , it' il all be over .
You know , what else can we do ?
We fess up .
- Fess up ?
- Yeah .
Yeah .
No , no , no .
We fess up .
We fess up .
We tell Nick .
We go and ask for forgiveness .
- Forgiveness ?
- Yes .
- Honey , you killed his horse !
- I' m telling him everything .
No , sweetheart !
Please .
Please don' t do it to me .
L love my car in the garage .
It' s got heated seats .
And I' ve got shoes .
I' ve got bags .
- [ Nick ]
Knock , knock .
- Clothes .
Oh , my God , I' m sorry .
Look at you two .
God , I' m so envious of you !
You' ve got to give Natalie a talk .
She' s locked herself in the bathroom and I want what you have so bad !
- I want some of that !
- Okay .
Shh !
Don' t say a word .
Not a word .
Not a word .
Okay ?
Everywhere I go , they yell , " Where does the shit go ? "
And we don' t know !
What if my opponent' s right ?
- What if we are polluting ?
- Natalie ...
The only thing this guy Shaunessey' s got going for him is your own guilt .
Guilt that you' re wealthy .
You know what , we' re partners now and we have money too .
You know what we' il do with ours ?
We' re going to sponsor the biggest rally for you that this town has ever seen .
[ Debbie ]
Then we' il throw out this challenge :
We' il say that if anyone can say that Vapoorize does damage to anything ,
Then Natalie Vanderpark will cease to be a candidate .
May I suggest we put on our dancing shoes ?
Honey !
I love you .
So how was the flight ?
Was it enjoyable ?
Yeah , it was fine .
It was very smooth .
Everything went fine .
Here' s what I got to tell you .
We' il pay you the money , okay ?
We got it all worked out .
That is sensational news , my little gypsy roving friend .
But I' ve revised my thinking about the $50, 000 grand thing .
L can' t accept that .
I mean , what are we , animals ?
- What ?
No , we' re not animals .
- No , of course not .
What we are is pals .
You slept in my bunk .
L ate some of your crackers .
We sang in the rain . ~ Valderi ~ Valdera ~ Valderi ~ Valdera ha ha ha ...
Okay .
~ My knapsack on my back
- Yes , I remember .
- That' s when we were buddies .
Last week ?
Yeah .
I remember .
So , what I' m saying is to hell with the flat cash payout .
L say let' s be partners .
- Partners ?
- Why not ?
- What do you mean " partners " ?
- You , me ...
Your other so- called friend in a cozy little triumvirate .
Am I using the word correctly ?
Listen to me .
We' re not partners , okay ?
How can we be partners ?
We' il iron out the details when I come over later .
- No .
- This evening .
Who knows exactly when .
- You' re not coming over here .
- Yes .
And don' t you worry , buddy partner .
I' il smooth out the rough parts .
- You want to talk ?
Where are you ?
- I' m coming over .
- You' re not coming over .
- Don' t you worry , buddy roll .
We' il put pen to paper .
Bye- bye .
- Listen to me .
- Bye- bye .
There are no rough parts to smooth ...
What ?
Hello ?
Oh , God .
All right .
I got to tell Nick .
I' m just going to tell him .
Come on , honey .
Start with your hips .
Come on .
Whoo !
Mr. Vanderpark !
Mr. Vanderpark !
Mr. Vanderpark !
Mr. Vanderpark !

L hate that thing .
I hate it .
Timmy , I' m sorry , we got to deal with it .
Nick , I gotta talk to you .
I did something really stupid .
You won' t believe what happened .
The stupidest , most ridiculous thing .
That wife of yours was incredible .
But I don' t care how much money we make , don' t buy one of these .
Lt' s junk .
It just keeps speeding up for no reason .
- Nick , I got to talk to you .

L' ve been feeling guilty for a long time .
- It' s impossible to turn it off .
- I did something really stupid .
- I hate you , merry- go- round .
- Where' s the switch ?
Lt' s in the middle of the thing .
It' s impossible to turn off .
- Where' s the button ?
- ln the middle .
L' il turn it off , then we' il talk .
L' il get it .
- Whoa !
Ow !
Oh !
Oh !
Timmy .
Man , are you all right ?
Let me help you up there .
Come on , buddy .
Come on , buddy .
Come on , buddy .
All right .
- You okay ?
Yeah ?
- Yeah .
Lt knocked the wind out of you .
You went flying off of that thing .
Now , listen .
I don' t want to let this ruin our jolly feeling .
Let' s go back in there and talk about this fantastic rally .
- No , Nick .
You see this bow and arrow ?
- Yeah .
- [ Tim ]
One night ...
- Yeah ?
One night ...
L' m so ashamed of this .
But one night ...
- Oh , my God !
- Oh , man !
- I told you it was a piece of junk !
- I' m glad we weren' t on it .
- What ?
- I' m glad we weren' t on it .
- I can' t hear .
Are your ears ringing ?
- No .
Boy , mine are .
What was it you were saying , my fine friend ?
What I was saying is that one night I got drunk .
All right ?
Being drunk had nothing to do with it .
I can' t even explain it .
Wait , you know what ?
I' m thinking it' s just one ear .
L hear you way better when I turn like this .
Talk to me .
That night I got drunk and I was aiming this arrow at my house .
No , it' s both ears .
What are you doing ?
L' m trying to tell you .
L pulled it back , I aimed at the house , I did this .
Nick , Nathan and Nellie want you to kiss their boo- boos .
Wait , I heard that .
I' m coming !
That was not a smart thing to do .
- I know !
- Come on .
No , Nick !
I got to tell ... [ groaning in distance ]
Oh , shit !
- Timmy , honey !
- What ? !
Where are you ?
Timmy .
Honey , I got it .
Definitely in the hips .
Timmy , where have you been ?
- I killed the bum .
- What ?
The bum .
I shot an arrow .
Lt went up , it went down .
It' s in the bum .
I killed him .
Come .
Come .
- Did you work out a deal with him ?
- No !
He' s dead .
Lt' s in his back .
The arrow .
I shot him .
I killed him .
L killed a person !
What ? ls this a joke ?
I don' t get your jokes sometimes .
And I' il tell you something :
I don' t think it' s always me .
- Hurry up !
Come on !
- Honey !
- Hurry .
Get in the house .
- Let it go .
Stop !
What are you doing ?
Wait !
He could be in the house .
- There' s nobody there !
God .
- Car !
He' s wounded !
He' s crazy !
- Honey , this is really insane .
- Get in !
Get in !
Excuse me .
This' il take half a second .
Could you tell me ...
What' s sticking in my back , please ?
- Arrow .
- Fricking nitwit .
Look , I' m being stalked by a genuine madman , okay ?
L' m talking about a black force here .
L hate spoiling the atmosphere ,
But would you mind tugging the arrow out ?
L want you to stop the car .
Honey , stop the car right now !
- Look .
The guy' s crazy .
- There is no dead man !
He' s a loose cannon .
- Excuse me .
Oh , my God , there is a bum with an arrow .
He looks afraid of us .
You ever hear of " reach for the sky " ?
You just shoot a guy in the back with no warning .
That' s right .
That' s correct .
That' s right .
That' s what I do .
Well , then , good God almighty ,
We have entered , indeed , into a dark day .
You got to talk to him .
We were pals .
Who shoots a pal in the back with a bow and arrow ?
- Over a couple of bucks .
- Me .
L' m an archer and I shoot arrows .
And I got more back where they came from .
My quiver .
Listen to me .
I just wanted what you wanted .
A little taste of the good life .
A little taste of honey .
ls that so bad ? ls it ?
But you win .
Man , I fold .
I can see it :
Greed has hardened your heart .
And money' s poisoned your soul .
L' m out of here .
There' s nothing as dangerous as large quantities of money .
That' s why I' ve always remained an independent contractor , an odd job man .
L want no part of this .
L stand before you , begging :
Take the arrow out of my back .
You will never see me again .
Help me , God !
Come on .
- Honey ...
Take the arrow out of his back .
Thank you .
- Thank you .
- Souvenir .
- Hey !
- Hey .
L couldn' t sleep .
I got to talk to you .
Yeah , I got to talk to you too .
You know , this big rally tomorrow , I' m a wreck about it .
L got to give a big speech .
I' m not a speech guy .
Are you kidding ?
Come on , those infomercials you did .
You' re great in front of people .
Really ?
You thought I was good ?
You never said a word about it .
Because it was just another thing of yours that made me miserable .
What ?
This is what I have to talk to you about .
Sit down .
L killed Corky .
You ...
When ?
Now , please , just don' t say anything till I' m done , all right ?
The day that you gave me the wine , remember ?
L got drunk on the wine .
L actually was drunk from before .
I went into your yard and ...
So that' s it .
There you have it .
Well , you know , it sounds like it was an accident .
- Why didn' t you tell me ?
- I should' ve told you .
That' s the thing .
But I don' t know what happened .
L felt guilty or something .
And I was just so wrapped up in the envy that I felt for everything you had .
Lt' s true what they say .
Lt' s like a little green monster that comes out and it just poisoned my head .
And , by the way , you did nothing wrong .
You followed your dream .
You did what you wanted to do .
L was always saying , " Don' t do it . "
You did it and it worked .
Look , you built a house , right ?
That' s all you did .
You built a house .
L mean , it' s a big house .
I mean , it' s a really big house .
Lt' s a large house .
It' s a ...
I mean , it' s ...
Lt' s gigantic , Nick .
It' s the White House .
You built the White House here , and we' re in the shadow of it .
Literally , every day at 4 : 00 , we' re in its shadow .
That' s not your fault .
You wanted to be friends still ,
You didn' t want to move and I love that .
Lt was coming from such a good place , but it was ...
Lt really got to me because every day I' d have to look at you ,
And see you with all of this stuff .
You know , buy the yellow Lamborghini that goes 500 miles an hour .
Have a bowling alley next to your room .
lf I could do it , I would .
Everybody should have a merry- go- round .
Of course you should .
Jealousy , every day .
And it was just chewing me up .
Your kid' s playing the concert piano , my kid' s banging trash cans .
And that has nothing to do with money .
That' s just his musical ability .
That' s a whole other thing .
You just gave to us .
You gave and you gave and you' re so generous .
And what am I going to give you ?
L gave you tube socks for Christmas last year .
That' s not going to work .
- I like the socks .
- You gave us so much .
The coffee machine .
It' s a beautiful , giant rocketship- sized coffee machine .
Debbie loved the coffee .
I' il tell you something , I never tasted it .
L wanted to tell you that .
L can' t even tell you I haven' t tried the coffee .
Like I' il feel better if I don' t drink your coffee .
And you gave our kids flan .
All of a sudden my son' s going ,
" Daddy , where' s the flan ? "
Lt felt like a dagger in my heart every time he' d request flan .
Lt made me feel little .
L felt like a little man who didn' t like flan .
The horse was great , Nick .
Of course you should have a horse .
Does it have to be a white horse that you come galloping up on ,
And it neighs and makes the whole thing ?
Of course .
Make it a beautiful horse that I think , honestly , didn' t like me .
Lt had nothing to do with anything , I never clicked with it .
L think the horse sensed something .
I think " horse sense " is a real thing .
Because the horse had a feeling .
He came over and sensed the envy I felt .
He' d come over and eat the apples .
He' d see me and give me a weird look .
L' m telling you .
You know how sometimes the side of a face and you get one eye ?
He would keep the eye on me and I knew he was thinking something .
That' s unrelated to what happened with the arrow .
That was an accident .
L swear to God .
I swear to God .
I couldn' t do it if I tried .
L' m sorry about this .
I feel horrible .
I feel bad .
L feel like I have this fountain in my yard that I don' t deserve .
L don' t deserve to be your partner .
L don' t deserve to be your friend .
I just ...
Well , you know what , Tim ?
You made a mistake .
You' re human .
Everyone makes mistakes .
So what , man ?
You' re still my best friend .
- Really ?
- Of course .
Of course .
Come on , man .
Lt was a big mistake .
Lt was a big mistake .
It was a doozy .
Corky .
- I' m sorry , Nick .
- No , no .
It' s okay .
L know how much you loved him and I ...
L did love Corky .
L never liked Corky .
L mean , he' s beautiful on the outside .
It' s just something wasn' t ...
We' re still partners .
There is no way you are getting out of this partnership .
- Okay .
- Okay ?
And I will see you tomorrow at the big rally .
- Yeah .
- Good .
Big day .
Big day .
Poor Corky .
One little target arrow .
You wouldn' t think that could kill a great big horse .
That' s exactly what I thought .
Lt' s one little arrow and when I shot the bum ...
He hardly seemed to notice .
You know , that fountain looked a lot better in Rome .
- Yeah .
- Well ...
C' est la vie , as the Romans say .
On this beautiful , clear day ,
L think it is appropriate that we clear the air
Of the toxic distortions that my husband and , by association , myself ,
Are somehow poisoning our environment in our efforts to purify it .
Lt' s not true .
No es verdad .
Ladies and gentlemen ...
Please help me welcome Nick Vanderpark and Tim Dingman .
Thank you .
Ladies and gentlemen , young people .
L stand here with my partner , Tim Dingman ...
That' s right .
... grateful for this opportunity to address the central question
Posed in so many colorful and eloquent variations .
Where is the shit ? !
My God .
Nick .
Nick !
Corky ?
Mr. and Mrs. Vanderpark , sorry we had to perform an autopsy ,
But when any large dead animal comes in proximity with the public
It must be examined immediately for health reasons .
L' m a little curious .
Did you feed your horse a lot of apples ?
Our neighbors have an apple tree .
Corky loved their apples .
- Did he ever defecate in their yard ?
- I imagine .
Can you tell me what you did when the horse defecated in your yard ?
We used Vapoorize because Nick invented it .
We get crates of it for free .
Well ...
Lt' s all making sense .
The horse was poisoned .
We did find a broken shaft of a small target arrow in the sternum ,
But that played no part in the horse' s death .
The horse died from the prolonged ingesting of a certain chemical ,
Which by itself is harmless , but when combined with certain fecal bacteria
Becomes a lethal poison .
A little person ?
Lethal poison .
That chemical is the ingredient in every can of your so- called miracle invention .
He had enough of it literally to kill a horse .
L am obligated , of course , to report this to the EPA .
EPA ?
Mmm- hmm .
Environmental Protection Agency ?
Do you have to do that ?
Right .
You have to .
- It' s all right .
- Every time without exception ?
The next item , an extra large bed that sleeps nine comfortably ,
For , let' s say , $1 00 .
XL bed , sleeping nine .
Got to love it for $1 00 . $ 72 for this white statue of a man on a horse with a spray can . $ 72 , anyone ?
No ?
Anybody need a portable phone ?
Everyone needs one .
You want one in your kitchen , in your extra bedroom .
You got a portable phone right there .
It' s going to go for $5 .
The next thing is item 31 .
L like this bug net .
Why don' t we find out the estimated cost ?
Oh , we' ve got two cases of a semi- gourmet flan .
L believe that' s some sort of custard dish or something .
The semi- gourmet flan is going to start the bidding at $4 .
- Nick ?
- Yeah .
L think I have an idea .
- Yeah ?
- Yeah .
Like a really big idea .
Really ?
When you got your idea , did you feel it immediately ?
Oh , yeah .
Right away .
You got one of those ?
Like one of my ideas ?
- I think so .
- What is it ?
Yes !
Hey .
Hey !
Stop the auction !
You just cannot eat flan and drive at the same time .
Look , I' ve got flan all over me .
Can' t somebody come up with a better idea ? !
- [ Tim ]
We have .
That' s right !
Be one of the millions enjoying the taste sensation sweeping the nation .
Nick' s talking about Pocket Flan !
Pocket Flan !
- No spoon , no mess !
- That' s right .
Three simple steps , folks .
- Just flip it !
- Flip it !
- Squeeze it !
- Squeeze it !
Mmm .
- And enjoy .
- Enjoy !
Wait a second , Tim .
What was that name again ?
Pocket Flan !
Lsn' t that just fantastic ?
No , Nick , it' s not fantastic .
It' s flan- tastic .
Yeah , but , Tim , Nick , I have a question .
How about us who are lactose- intolerant ?
We' ve got a new soy- based Pocket Flan .
Lt' s flan in a tube .
Lt' s a little bit of happiness in a tube .
Let' s say I' m jogging .
L' m getting tired , I need a pick- me- up .
What am I going to do , get a candy bar ?
Lmagine if you' re jogging with some of this stuff .
What' s going on ?
It' s not going to work .
Here' s the other thing .
You' re eating your flan , you' re like :
" That' s good .
" I want to get down there where it' s brown and super- sugary . "
Where do you ... ?
I can' t ...
ln here we' ve mixed it up .
You' ve got all that .
It' s pre- mixed .
The brown is always part of it .
Even if you don' t see it .
Ln the Tour de France , they' re going 20 miles a day , going up mountains .
What do you think they pull out of their Spandex bikini bottom
To squeeze into their mouth when they want to eat ?
- Pocket Flan !
- And here' s another question .
What if I' m doing some skydiving and I' m like :
" I got to get some ...
I' m going to get some cornflakes .
" I don' t have time for cornflakes .
I do have time for flan . "
That' s right .
I' d love to see this ...
This has been vacuum- tested
To a depth of 200 feet if you' re scuba diving .
Just the other day I see this kid walking down the street .
- He has the Pocket Flan .
Right ?
- Right .
He squeezes it ... he' s on a skateboard .
He squeezes it ...
Lt arcs up .
He goes like ... and ...
That' s like a new skateboard trick .
Who here likes to drive ?
You guys like to drive ?
Yeah .
Who here likes to drive race cars ?
Anybody ?
All right .
L' m Captain Speedway ,
And nothing tastes better at 200 miles per hour than Pocket Flan .
Firemen .
" I got to go save someone .
Maybe I need a little extra something . "
" Where am I gonna put my hose ?
I can' t hold the hose and this thing .
- " Where' s the hose go ?
" I put a hose under my arm and then I fight the fire . "
This is on a serious note .
Recently we received a letter from a woman , Gladys , who ...
Well , Pocket Flan saved her life .
- All right .
She was a backpacker .
She was stuck out in the woods ...
And , by God , Pocket Flan ...
L can' t think of it .
L wanted to say some tearful thing , but I couldn' t think of a thing .
