Boxers !
Not one step further .
The keeper of the lmperial Seal .
Just the man I was looking for .
A woman .
You Chinese are very progressive .
A gift from an old friend .
Wu Chow .
He wanted me to send his regards .
Father !
[ Gasps ]
Father .
The seal .
You must get it back .
I promise .
Give this ... to your brother .
[ Chuckles ]
What are you reading ?
Oh .
" Roy O' Bannon vs. The Mummy . "
It' s incredible .
Roy' s just taken out the Mummy' s entire army of zombie confederate soldiers , and he only had one bullet .
That' s impossible .
Oh , no , it' s not .
Roy figured out the physics of the canyon and then ricocheted a bullet off the canyon wall .
Nailed each zombie through the heart .
What about the Shanghai Kid ?
He was captured and knocked out on page 10 while he was polishing Roy' s pearl handles .
Don' t you worry .
Roy' s about to save him from becoming a human sacrifice .
Those stories are all lies .
No .
See ?
It says right here on the back .
" Author Sage McCallister bases all his stories on firsthand accounts . "
[ Horse whinnying ]
Sorry , sheriff .
No princess .
Every day you meet the noon stage .
Every day it' s the same story .
She' s not coming back .
Pei Pei' s married to her work in San Francisco .
Modern woman .
Sheriff , you got a parcel .
Hey , maybe it' s from her !
No .
It' s from my sister in China .
[ Horse neighs ]
I know .
I know .
I must go .
Stay here and be a good horsey for the new sheriff .
Uh , sheriff , that stage is headed east .
lsn' t China kind of west of here ?
I' m not going to China .
I' m going to New York .
Roy invested my money .
ls it true that he lives in a penthouse at the top of the Ritz surrounded by dozens of beautiful women at his every beck and call ?
That' s the old Roy .
He' s married , settled down .
Trust me , he' s changed .
[ Women laughing ]
So there we were .
Completely outnumbered .
He didn' t have to tell me we didn' t stand a chance .
So I send the Shanghai Kid and the princess out the back .
Poor Shanghai Kid .
He was so frightened .
He forgot to thank me for saving his life .
I' m used to that .
Now , I returned to the front , and I counted to three ... and I burst out of the mission .
Pearl handles blazing .
Lead flying everywhere .
And not a single bullet touched me .
- No !
- Yeah .
What happened to the emperor' s gold ?
Well , we divided it up .
I insisted on giving my share to the lndians .
The savages ?
Please don' t ever call those noble people savages .
lf being proud of your body and wanting to ride around naked all day makes you a savage , then , by God , you' re drinking with a savage .
[ Slurping , laughing ]
And that is what you call a French toast .
You are so sophisticated , Mr. O' Bannon .
Whoo !
Who' s up for some more bubbly ?
[ Fingers tapping rhythmically ]
Reach for the sky , Roy .
Say that again .
Reach for the sky , Roy .
Chon Wang !
You sly son of a gun !
- Look at you !
- Look at you !
- What brings you to New York ?
- My share of the gold .
Refresh my memory .
What gold ?
The emperor' s gold .
Okay , now , that gold is in what the Wall Street pros call a long- term investment .
We can' t touch it because it' s building .
I need it tonight .
You just got here .
Let' s celebrate .
No .
I don' t have time .
- You just got to the big city .
- My father' s been killed .
Chon , I' m ...
You need the money to get back for the funeral ?
No .
I must go to England .
The ship leaves tonight .
Your father died in England ?
China .
My sister followed the murderer to London .
Wait .
Murderer .
I' m a little bit mixed up .
Let me see if I can get the facts straight .
You have a sister ?
You never told me you had a sister .
ls she pretty or does she look like you ?
Be honest .
Roy , I need my money !
I don' t like that tone of voice .
You think after all we' ve been through I' d stiff you ?
I' m doing pretty well for myself .
Yeah .
- I' m sorry , Roy .
- That' s okay .
You' re going through a really tough time right now .
You got to be more trusting of people , okay ?
Look at me .
It' s Roy .
The couple at table 5 is ready to order .
Do you work here ?
No , I don' t work here .
It looks like these guys are wearing a similar jacket .
Roy , here' s your cut of the tips .
It' s the craziest thing .
I guess because I come in here so much they' re mistaking me for a waiter .
- It' s embarrassing .
- You lost the gold .
- Not all of it .
- Where' s the rest ?
I have one word for you .
Zeppelin .
I need my money now !
- Easy , easy .
- [ Woman laughing ]
Will you do anything for this money ?
Yes .
I must leave tonight .
Okay .
Take this key .
Go to the room .
Get cleaned up .
Your old pal Roy' s got a plan .
Go !
Come on !
Howdy , big boy .
What ?
There' s a woman in there !
She wants me to sleep with her .
Of course she does .
I told her the Great Wall ain' t the only big thing coming out of China .
- Why did you say that ?
- So you could get the money .
I will not sleep with women for money !
Why ?
I' m gonna sleep with her for money .
Chon , just go in there and do your business and think about your sister in England .
- What ?
- Roy !
- Duty calls .
- Roy !
Good evening , Mr. Mayor .
Where are they ?
Who ?
[ Grunts ]
My daughters .
10th floor .
[ Ringing ]
Roy ?
Roy , you got trouble .
Roy !
I got to check on something .
I' il be right back .
Chon , new plan .
We got to go .
- Chon , what are you doing ? !
- [ Woman moans ]
I' m fixing her back .
Put her down , you decadent Philistine .
[ Both grunt ]
Hey , Chon , come on !
Let' s go !
- Bye- bye .
- Bye .
Come on !
[ Sighs deeply ]
I don' t understand .
What' s going on ?
I don' t have time to explain .
All you have to know is there are bad men after us ... but I' m in the right .
- Roy .
- You gotta trust me on this .
Okay , look .
I' m in a transitional phase in my life .
- But ...
- But what ?
You want to know the truth ?
I' m a little lost right now .
I see you .
You' ve got a sense of purpose .
But look at me .
I' m a 30- year- old waiter/ gigolo .
Where' s the future in that ?
So what' s the plan ?
You were always my compass , Chon .
The plan .
You ask me the right questions .
The plan ?
The plan , I think , is to find the right woman .
Raise a lot of children and teach them values .
No , Roy .
The plan to get out of here .
Okay , the plan .
Here we go .
[ Bell dings ]
[ Whistles , gasps ]
- Cops !
Cops !
- They can help us .
No , no .
Chon , not these cops .
These are dirty cops .
They take advantage of people .
Now , if they stop us , remember , I' m not Roy O' Bannon .
Who are you ?
I' m your friend Smoky Desperado from the West .
And who am l ?
You .
You' re Benihana .
- Benihana .
- Yeah .
You teach crippled children yoga here in the city .
- You go first .
- No !
Why me ?
Because you blend in , okay ?
Now , go !
Don' t let them see you !
Benihana .
Hey !
Hey !
Ooh .
Psst !
Chon !
Come on .
Stop wasting time .
You !
Chon , I found our ticket out of here .
ROY :
We' re on our way .
Looks like old Roy came through again .
Just like old times , Chon .
MAN :
Check over there !
- Over to the alley !
- That way !
Yeah , just like old times .
Will you forget about the gold for a second ?
You' re gonna have more money than you ever dreamed of when that first zeppelin takes off .
Why do I always believe you ?
What do you mean ?
You' re lucky I didn' t invest in that ridiculous automobile idea .
Yeah , that' s gonna make a lot of money .
[ Whimpering ]
What' s that ?
Doghouse .
I' m in the doghouse .
Oh , come on , Chon .
Look , I' m sorry I lied .
I just didn' t want to disappoint you .
That' s exactly what I mean .
I can' t take that look .
I learned it from my father .
That' s how he used to look at me .
What did your dad do ?
Was he an lmperial Guard ?
No .
Much more important .
He was the keeper of the lmperial Seal .
That' s what I love about China .
Everybody' s job description sounds so damn cool .
The seal has been symbol of the emperor' s power since Genghis Khan .
It has been passed down from one emperor to another .
My family have been watching over it for 12 generations .
12 generations ?
My father and I used to skip stones across the moat and talk about a day I would follow his footsteps .
I was his only son .
lf I' d have been there , I could have protected him .
It' s not your fault .
You were 3, 000 miles away .
What' s with that little box ?
My sister sent it to me from my father .
- There' s a message inside .
- What' s it say ?
It' s a puzzle box .
I don' t know how to open yet .
What do you mean ?
Get a hammer and smash it open so you can see what it says .
I must have patience .
By the time I' m able to open it ...
I will be ready to read the message .
Come on , Confucius .
That' s the corniest thing I' ve ever heard .
Let me see this .
You know what ?
We' re gonna go to England .
We' re gonna find your dad' s killer .
We' re gonna get that seal back .
There' s no reward for this , Roy .
Who said anything about a reward ?
I' m talking about friendship , loyalty , honor .
Okay ?
Thank you , Roy .
And I hear England is ass soup .
A lot of pretty girls there .
[ Gavel bangs ]
First order of business , my Lords ... is a report from our esteemed friend Lord Rathbone ... who recently returned from a diplomatic mission to China .
Fellow Lords ...
I' m afraid I bring disturbing news from the Orient .
The opium wars have ravaged the land .
The emperor' s enemies are organizing .
The most vicious are the Boxers .
A godless band of rebels who murder without discretion .
China is not well .
[ Murmuring ]
I have brought back an envoy who should give us some insight into the inscrutable mind of the Chinese .
[ Tiger growling ]
[ Murmuring ]
ls he mad ?
Given to Her Majesty Queen Victoria by the emperor in recognition of her 50 glorious years on the throne .
[ Growling ]
Outrageousness !
Long live the queen .
[ Growling ]
# England swings like a pendulum do #

BOY :
Jack the Ripper strikes again !
Extra !
Extra !
Read all about it .
Howdy , partner .
The English are not very friendly .
They' re just sore losers .
What did they lose ?
A little thing called the American Revolution , Chon .
Never heard of it .
I' il give you the highlights .
They came over with about a million men .
We had a bunch of farmers with pitchforks and beat ' em like a drum .
Hey !
I' m walking here !
You' re driving on the wrong side of the road !
Bunch of amateurs .
These people don' t get it .
Hello , ladies .
[ Women laughing ]
Look at you .
What ?
I' m not supposed to notice a pretty lady ?
I thought you wanted to settle down and have a family .
I do , Chon .
I just hope I can .
Why not ?
Sometimes I worry that all the damn horseback riding
I did out in the West , bouncing up and down on the hard saddles might have made it so my salmon don' t swim upstream the way they' re supposed to .
What ?
I might be shooting blanks .
Oh .
Don' t say anything .
Roy , it' s okay .
Some people are not meant to have a family .
I' ve always had such a special connection with children .
The little ankle biters .
Hey , watch it , you little punk !
Pardon me , guv .
You gents lost your way ?
Yeah .
We' re looking for my sister .
She' s staying at 32 Oxford Street .
I know it well , guv .
Me old man used to live there .
Can you show us the way ?
Well , memory' s a little dodgy .
But I' m sure for a bob I could get you there .
What do you take us for ?
Okies from Muskogee ?
Go sell your bullshit someplace else .
We' re not buying .
Thanks for the tip , guv .
Hey !
I stole that watch from my uncle !
What ?
This way .
Come here , you little rubbish eater !
What did I tell you about poaching on our turf , Charlie ?
I' m on the straight and narrow .
Honest .
What' s this , then ?
After I' m through beating you ... you' re gonna wish you never ran away from the workhouse !
CHON :
Leave the boy alone .
Bloody tourists !
Get your noses out of it !
Do whatever you want to the kid ... but that' s my watch .
Well , there' s a load of us and only two of you .
So piss off !
Easy , fellas .
You' ve lost one war this way .
Don' t make the same mistake twice .
[ Whistles ]
Come on !
After him !
Hey !
MAN :
There he is !
Get him !
We' ve got him now .
Move in , lads .
Boys , boys , wait , wait !
MAN :
Come on !
Get him !
Up the bloody ladder !
[ Gasps ]
Hey !
Hey !
WOMAN :
Oh !
Watch it !
Hey .
Ah !
Come here , you !
Cool .
Move it !
[ " Singing in the Rain " plays ]
You !
Did you see that ?
It' s okay .
Okay ? !
I call that one my kung pao chicken .
I clotheslined the sucker .
[ Whistle blows ]
MAN :
Come on , get back !
Clear away !
Make way !
I think you gentlemen should accompany me back to the yard .
This isn' t a yard !
It' s a jail !
Roy , calm down .
Unbelievable .
Wait !
Someone' s coming !
- Let me handle this .
- I' m gonna handle it .
The English aren' t like you .
They don' t get all emotional .
Touchy- feely .
Do me a favor .
Park the kung fu .
Let me do the talking .
Come here .
Let me give you a hug .
Ooh !
[ Laughs ]
I' ve been after that Fleet Street gang for two years .
Then you two come along and bring them down in a single afternoon .
Brilliant !
Now , um ...
Oh , that' s my watch !
Yes .
A street urchin turned it in .
The little punk better not have scuffed it .
- I hope your luck picks up .
- What do you mean ?
I deduced from your watch that you' d hit a rough patch .
He has .
How do you know ?
It' s an investigative technique I' ve developed .
I can deduce intimate details about an individual through a close scrutiny of their personal effects .
What else can you tell ?
The owner of this watch is a bad gambler and a lousy shot .
Although he' s cheated death several times ... he spends most of his life wandering in a rather pathetic and futile search for purpose and respect .
Oh , yes .
He has a penchant for loose women .
Wow .
That' s amazing .
I' m sure it' s a very popular party trick at birthdays for small children ... but it doesn' t quite play with adults .
Just to set the record straight .
Roy O' Bannon is not attracted to loose women .
Loose women are attracted to me .
- You' re Roy O' Bannon ?
- Yeah .
The famous Western folk hero ?
Have you heard of me ?
Have I heard of you ?
I' ve only read " Roy O' Bannon vs. The Mummy " five times .
It' s fascinating .
I want you to meet the Shanghai Kid .
Oh , yes .
The faithful Chinese sidekick .
I' m not a sidekick .
Those stories are all lies .
Come on , don' t be bitter .
I can' t help what Sage McCallister writes .
lf there' s anything I can do , I' m at your service .
We' re looking for my sister .
She' s staying at this address .
Can you take us there ?
Oh , dear .
I think you' d better come with me .
Lin .
Wang .
lf you don' t mind , I' il just wait outside .
[ Clears throat ]
lntroduce me .
Oh .
This is Lin , my baby sister .
Roy O' Bannon .
Pleasure .
You never told me your sister was such a ... beautiful lotus blossom .
What' d she say ?
No , no , no .
No talking about me in your native tongue .
Why are you in jail ?
I followed the man who murdered Father .
And ?
I found out where he live .
I snuck inside his house and tried to kill him .
It' s my duty to find Father' s killer .
No , it is mine !
I' m the one who promised Father .
But I' m his only son .
When you abandoned us for America ...
Father said he had no son .
What ?
Whoa .
Time out .
Time out .
Come here .
The detective' s a fan .
Why don' t I play the celebrity card ?
We' il get her out that way .
- Okay ?
- Okay .
Don' t worry .
I' il get you out .
Everything' s gonna be okay .
ln fact , I' m gonna give you my good- luck playing cards .
Just ignore the naked ladies .
Wang !
Have you opened Father' s box ?
Not yet .
She tried to assassinate Lord Rathbone whilst he was taking afternoon tea .
He' s 10th in line to the throne ...
Her Majesty' s favorite cousin ... and the finest swordsman in England .
So , of course , the press had a field day .
The story actually knocked Jack the Ripper off the front page .
Artie , Lin is not a killer .
She' s just a really , really , really hot ... confused Chinese girl .
Maybe if I agreed to sign a few autographs and talk to some of my fans here in England ... do some type of charity event , can we get her out that way ?
I' m afraid that' s out of the question .
What will happen to my sister ?
She' il go to trial , probably be locked away in an institution for the criminally insane .
The tabloids have already dubbed her " Loony Lin . "
I thought it was rather catchy .
At the time .
[ Exhales sharply ]
Do you have any notion what would happen if we were to be seen together ?
Since your return , I have yet to lay eyes on the lmperial Seal .
I' m hosting a jubilee ball at my country estate tomorrow .
Be at the stables at midnight .
As requested , a token of my esteem .
This is where you get out .
I hope there will be more trust between us when I' m emperor and you are the new king .
Wow .
Buckingham Palace .
Look at that , Chon .
That' s where the queen lives .
Hey , look at this guy .
CHON :
He' s a royal guard .
He has a very important job .
I used to be just like him .
No , they' re nothing like you .
They' re a tourist attraction .
You can make faces at them , insult them ... and they can' t move a muscle .
- Here .
Watch this .
- Roy ...
No , it' s okay .
Hey , buddy , your shoes are untied .
[ Whistling ]
That is the biggest damn beaver I have ever seen .
Roy , stop it .
The queen !
Look !
The queen !
She' s mooning us !
He almost went for that .
My friend and I just came over from America .
You might have heard of it .
We run your jerkwater country .
Come on , you gonna take that from a colonial ?
Roy , stop it .
I bet you are one hell of a damn poker player .
No hard feelings .
Huh ?
ROY :
They can' t do that !
You' re not allowed to do that !
Shouldn' t have touched him .
You scram , you little punk .
I' ve got friends at Scotland Yard .
I' il give you up in a heartbeat .
You get your watch back ?
Don' t worry about my watch .
Go on .
It' s a knockoff .
What are you talking about ?
My uncle stole this watch from President Lincoln .
It' s a priceless family heirloom .
Not according to the pawnbroker .
You should not steal .
lf I don' t steal , I don' t eat .
Who showed you how to do all that kicking and punching ?
My father .
Have you ever heard of those ?
They' re parents .
You don' t ' cause you' re a little orphan .
Now , go on .
You' re cramping our style .
[ Thunder rumbles ]
Oh , this country blows .
You need a place to stay ?
Come on in and warm your dogs .
ROY :
[ Whistles ]
You can get into a lot of trouble breaking into a place like this .
That being said , well done .
You just ate the last chocolate .
Course I did .
You gotta look out for number one .
I could really get used to this .
Living the life of a country gentleman .
Maybe doing a little painting .
Let Lin play in the garden with the children .
Vera , Chuck , and Dave .
Who' s Lin ?
Lin' s the most beautiful woman I' ve ever met .
She' s gonna be the savior of the house of O' Bannon .
Chon , check out the threads .
All I' m missing is the loyal hound curled at my feet .
We are wasting time .
We must find Rathbone .
What do you think I' ve been doing ?
Sitting here drinking expensive hooch ?
Refill .
I' ve been working on a plan .
Now -- Whoa .
Don' t slosh the brandy .
- It messes with the bouquet .
- Sod off .
I' m trying to teach you a skill set .
Help get you off the street .
- Bartenders make big bucks .
- Roy !
The plan .
Thank you , Chon .
lf we find the seal ... we can prove Rathbone killed your dad .
It' s the old Hail Mary play .
I also have a version where we dig a tunnel .
Hey !
Bloody catapult .
Jesus Christ !
- You don' t need a catapult !
- Who asked you ?
You don' t interrupt grown- ups when they' re talking .
" Lord Nelson Rathbone requests the pleasure of your company at the jubilee ball in honor of Her Majesty' s 50th year on the throne . "
Sounds good .
It doesn' t address security .
They' re not gonna let Chon and I waltz into the castle .
All you need is a proper disguise .
I do like a good disguise .
I look like a fool .
What ? !
You' re a maharaja .
That' s lndian royalty .
- But I' m Chinese .
- It' s the same thing .
Bob your head a little bit .
Gives you more of a lndia- royalty flavor .
That' s good .
Good show , good show .
Good show , good show .
- Cheerio , cheerio .
- Cheerio , cheerio .
What do we do when we see Rathbone ?
Kill him .
No , okay ?
No !
You' re gonna be civil , ' cause we don' t have the seal .
No seal .
No Lin .
No family honor .
Okay ?
Be cool .
Okay , we look great .
Let' s enjoy this party .
- Whoa .
What are you doing ?
- I' m going inside .
- The place is haunted .
- You' re the harness man .
You get back at the carriage .
You wait in case we need to make a quick getaway .
Go on .
Man your post .
You don' t always get what you want .
Why are you so mean to that boy ?
I see a lot of myself in that kid .
It' s kind of freaking me out .
Come on .
[ Exhales deeply ]
Your name , please , sir .
So I can announce you .
Sherlock ... Holmes .
Sherlock Holmes .
Which province do you represent , Your Highness ?
Nevada .
May I present Major General Sherlock Holmes and His Highness , the maharaja of Nevada .
How are the security arrangements ?
Oh , everything seems to be going swimmingly , my Lord .
And if I may say so ... it is an honor to guard Your Lordship tonight .
I speak for all of us at Scotland Yard when I say that no matter how far you are from the throne ... you' il always be number one in our hearts .
Okay , here' s the plan .
We' re gonna get a little chow .
Then we' re gonna sneak out of here .
- Start looking for that seal .
- Okay .
- Spotted Dick , sir ?
- What ?
Spotted Dick .
Can you believe this guy ?
I' m trying to get something to eat .
He' s asking me if I got the clap .
I think he' s offering you food .
Oh .
Spotted Dick .
Oh , no .
I think I' il pass .
I' m not really a dessert man .
Perhaps my friend might like some Spotted Dick .
[ Laughs ]
I might try one of these sausages .
A little smoky Joe .
Mmm !
This is good !
I thought the food here was supposed to suck .
The haggis is fresh from Scotland , sir .
It' s made from the finest sheeps ' bladders .
I' m gonna get some whiskey and wash my mouth out .
You should try the quail .
I shot them myself this morning .
How do you do , Your Lordship ?
Very well , thank you .
I' m not acquainted with the Nevada province .
But I haven' t been to lndia since ' 81 .
I spent most of my time in the Orient .
I hear you' ve just returned from China .
You are well- informed , maharaja .
It is my dream that the Chinese people will follow lndia' s example and one day embrace British rule .
The Chinese are very proud .
They place family and honor above all else .
Well , I' m sure we can break them of that .
lf you' il excuse me , I have a matter to attend to .
Until we meet again .
Patience .
I' m proud of you , Chon .
We must find the seal .
What do you see ?
Shh , shh , shh !
He just pulled a fancy dragon key out of his desk .
That was my father' s !
I must avenge his honor .
Hey , slow down , tiger .
Slow down .
Quit going all Chinese on me .
Where is he ?
Damn it .
Remember your puzzle box .
Patience .
Okay , there are no windows .
We just came in through the only doorway .
That leaves one explanation .
Remember in " Roy O' Bannon vs. The Mummy " how the zombie king got away when I chased him into the pharaoh' s tomb ?
There' s a secret passageway behind the sphinx .
There' s gotta be a lever or a button over here .
Help me lift some stuff up .
Roy !
The painting .
It' s looking at me .
- Look !
- Oh , yeah .
Looks like it' s looking at me .
That' s great .
No , real eyes .
Moving !
That kid got to you , didn' t he ?
Unbelievable !
We' re not in a haunted house .
That' s a technique that an artist uses .
" Ubiquitous gaze " or " pursuant eyes " is the technical term .
It' s unnerving , though .
I' il give you that .
Roy .
Now , those eyes .
Look !
Whatever you say , Chon .
Let' s see what you got here , Rathbone .
Roy !
What , Chon ?
Are the statues moving now ?
Wow .
Mm- mmm !
Roy !
I can' t hear myself think with you shouting at me .
Chon ?
Chon ?
Chon ?
This is ridiculous .
lf you want to act like a child and play games ... then find someone else ...
' cause I take this stuff seriously .
I' m here to work .
I' m on a mission .
Chon ?
Okay , Chon .
Okay , you little Chinese otter .
Let' s play .
Ha !
Chon , demons !
She' s gonna fight my battles for me .
Come on .
Let' s go .
What ?
What are you doing ?
It' s kinky .
I like it .
Wow !
Look at this .
Wait .
There' s something different about this room .
Hey .
