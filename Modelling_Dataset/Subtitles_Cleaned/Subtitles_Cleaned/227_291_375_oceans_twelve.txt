Hi .
- How' d it go ?
- Lousy .
Got a ' 63 Thunderbird I would' ve sold in a day a year ago .
Now they just wanna look at the pictures .
You smell nice .
How was your day ?
It was great .
We had a big breakthrough in the Bulgari case .
Really ?
We found a boot print .
A really good one .
The left heel was worn way down .
That' s a good lead .
I know .
We found a hair .
A hair , wow .
It' s at the lab .
So hopefully by noon tomorrow we' il find out his DNA ... ... what kind of conditioner he uses , if he streaks his hair ... ... if he has dandruff , everything .
Isn' t that amazing ?
That is amazing .
You know , having those extra men really paid off .
Oh , you' re just being modest .
Are you coming to bed , baby ?
I' m just gonna have a shower .
Don' t let me keep you up .
- Good morning .
- Good morning .
- And you are Mr ... ?
- Diaz .
Miguel Diaz .
- And you' re here to open a ... ?
- A SEP retirement account .
Terrific .
Oh , it says here you' re already retired .
- I am .
- What was your occupation ?
I was a high school basketball coach .
You must have done very well for yourself .
- What' s your name ?
- Greg .
Greg .
Let me ask you something .
Do you have safe- deposit boxes here ?
Yes , they' re housed in our vault .
- In your vault ?
- It' s over 100 years old .
Of course , we' ve made some state- of- the- art upgrades since then .
You know , I was once in a vault while it was being robbed .
That must have been quite an experience .
Yeah .
Yeah .
That' s too oxblood .
What do y' all do ?
My husband and I ?
Well , he' s retired .
Just retired .
It' s great .
It' s ...
And I did work at an art gallery .
And , you know , I love art , obviously , and paint and ...
That' s too brown .
I' m sorry .
Do you mind if I ... ?
- Hey , it' s your paint .
- Okay .
Thank you .
May I show you something specific ?
Well , I was looking for something for my wife .
What is it , a special occasion ?
It' s our second third anniversary .
Excuse me .
Hello , Mrs. Diaz , we were just talking about you .
I mean great .
No , you mean easy .
You' re doing recon work on our anniversary ?
That' s an interesting way to ease back into society , which was your idea .
There' s water in the basement and the pilot light is out .
Hello , Tess .
Where is he , Tess ?
Where is ... ... Mr. Diaz ?
I want it back , Tess .
I want it all back .
- You got it all from the insurance company .
- I want my money back .
The money that your husband and his 10 friends stole from me .
With interest .
A hundred and sixty million dollars over three years .
That' s a lot of vig .
And I want it all back .
He' s got two weeks .
You' il never find them .
They' re way too smart for you .
Right .
You know , as it turns out ... ... l' m not the only person in the world looking for Ocean' s 11 .
All right .
I' m the groom , and I' m not supposed to say anything , but ...
Make a speech .
But I don' t care what the rules are , because I really wanna thank my family .
My mom and dad , my Uncle Gary and Aunt Grace .
Uncle Ted , Aunt celeste ... ... and their children , Denise and Jessica .
Bishop Tom and his wife , Helen , my neighbor John ... ... and his new girlfriend , Tanya .
And all the guys at Lean Machine Inc . , Bobo , Mullethead ... ... Big Sam .
And everyone else who' s just been great ... ... in welcoming Sara into the family .
Thank you .
Excuse me , everybody .
I' d just like to ...
- Get up .
- Get up .
- Get up .
- Get up .
Get up .
- Walk .
- Walk .
I' d like to say a few words about commitment ... ... about honor ... ... about responsibility ... ... about a very special someone and admitting to her ...
Get up .
Pull the chair out .
Admitting to her in front of everybody ... ... that her wedding ... ... and that very special honeymoon trip to Epcot center ... ... will have to be postponed .
The photographer .
Jesus , he' s just a friend .
You met him at The Mint , remember ?
Well , of course I am .
You don' t expect me to embarrass myself by flying commercial ?
On a budget ?
On a budget ?
Who was the only person who couldn' t get in on the chinese cell- phone market ?
You , with all your connections .
What was that ?
He seemed really nice .
And you know it' s hard for guys to be friends with me .
And you do this every time that I meet someone new .
And you know what ?
It' s getting really boring .
You think it' s a accident no one know about Fred " Bud " Kelly ?
Ain' t no accident .
There' s one explanation ... ... and you ladies know exactly what it is .
I' m gonna tell you what it is .
Conspiracy , collusion , complicity .
That' s all it is .
Let me break it down like a fraction for you about my man Fred " Bud " Kelly .
Fred " Bud " Kelly made skates out of whiskey bottles ... ... at his uncle' s farm in the early 1900s .
That was over there in Nova Scotia .
I' m gonna tell you something else .
You never seen his name on the Stanley cup .
You know why that is ?
Because that son of a bitch Jim crow ... ... took his name off the history books .
You kind of ...
Seems like every time I see you , you' re playing the race card , Frank .
Now , why is that ?
You can let go of my feet now .
- This don' t bother you ?
- Of course it ******* bothers me , mate .
- What the **** do you want me to do ?
- Well , it' s ****** up .
You can' t hear none of the lyrics .
You can' t get with the beat with all them ******* bleeps in it .
You want a ******* single on the ******* radio , it' s what you have to ******* do .
Well , it' s ****** , isn' t it ?
Totally ****** ! ******* right , it' s ************* .
What the **** is that ?
Somebody must be in 2 .
Oh , **** !
And you haven' t contacted my father about any of this ?
Because , really , I don' t think there' s any reason to involve him or my mom .
It' s all on you , Linus .
Okay .
Good .
- Good .
Because I have a whole network ...
- Get out of my car .
Thank you .
There appears to be a slight problem with your card .
Oh , well , yes .
Here .
I' m afraid not , sir .
Why ?
Your business manager said you would understand .
Todd said I would understand ?
No , Mr. Benedict .
Mr. Benedict .
Mr ...
Oh , yes .
An old friend , a practical joker .
Tell Mr. Benedict he' s won this round , yes .
Terry Benedict .
Old Terry .
She' s looking at me from across the room .
And she' s crazy about me , I can tell ... ... because she' s been staring at me all night .
So suddenly ... ... I just go up to her , and I grab her .
And I' ve got her really close to me ... ... and her eyes are all fiery .
And my eyes are fiery .
And it' s like ...
It' s electric .
And I say to her , " Mom ...
Mother ... "
what ?
Thanks for letting me finish .
What can I say ?
You' re a funny guy .
Oh , yeah .
My friend Rusty .
I' m worried about him .
He owns this hotel in Los Angeles ... ... losing a lot of money , and he' s got no life .
He' s a nice , bright kid , but he' s beating his brains out .
Do you think I could send something through you , like , a message to him ?
I read your palm , not his .
Somebody who could do that could do very well .
Anything on my health ?
- My hips are bothering me .
- Please .
This ?
You couldn' t see this ?
- I tried knocking , he won' t open .
- I' il handle it .
I know him .
Jesus christ , are you people retarded ?
- It says , " Do not disturb " !
- It' s me .
Hey .
Come on in .
Jeez , Topher , you didn' t have to go all Frankie Muniz on me .
I' m sorry .
Rust , look , I know this is your joint .
I just ...
There' s this girl .
I love her , man .
I love her , but she is driving me crazy !
I can' t sleep .
I can' t work .
I quit the show .
I totally phoned in that Dennis Quaid movie .
- I mean , it' s like ...
- Hello ?
God , it' s almost like this Kabbalah crap doesn' t even work !
Rusty , call for you .
Dude , don' t leave .
You used some nasty words .
I got sensitive ears .
Think about that night a lot , don' t you ?
I thought I' d be dead before I heard the sound that killed me .
Now , you told me that your wife said that he called it Ocean' s 11 .
Now , who decided that ?
I' m a private contractor .
It was a collaboration .
That moniker is insulting .
It was one job we did together .
I don' t know where this proprietary stance comes from .
It seems possessive .
One could make the argument that because it was Danny' s idea ...
Hang on a minute .
We all had our own areas of expertise .
I mean , without us , it don' t leave your head , mate .
It just hurts , you know , because ... ... it seemed we all agreed to call it " the Benedict job . "
That' s what we called it when we were doing it .
If you wanted to call it something else ... when you have a problem , who do you go to ?
- Rusty .
- Rusty .
Thanks .
Let' s get back on the topic .
Based on what we stole , plus interest ... ... how much does everybody owe ? - $17 . 34 million .
Assuming Benedict gives us prime plus one , which I doubt .
Figure 19 to be safe .
Okay , 19 each .
Anybody got that ?
What , you think the stock market' s some great mystery ... ... beyond the realm of human understanding ?
Didn' t you see the signs ?
I saw the signs .
How much is everybody short ?
How much you short ?
Fourteen .
Fourteen .
- All but 5 million ?
- Yeah .
You gonna start with me ?
You don' t know what it' s like to create something from scratch .
- Well , with interest , I' m short 7 .
- Eight .
I spent about a million , mostly on talent development .
That makes it 7 for me .
Boy , the interest just kills you .
- I' m light 9 .
- What' s the interest ?
- About 6 .
- Then I owe 6 .
- How ?
- What ?
I' ve been staying at my parents ' .
I owe 25 .
Hotels , man .
Saul ?
I haven' t spent it all , but I will .
I' m out , fellas .
As ranking old- timer , I gotta say , I just can' t do it .
At my age , I think I earned the right to be selfish .
I wanna thank you all for the wonderful opportunity .
You' re all aces in my book .
But I want the last check I write to bounce .
Saul , you having a laugh ?
Saul .
- I can handle Saul' s share .
- You don' t have to .
Who would I talk to if you were all dead ?
That' s a good point .
All right , I owe 10 .
Amazing ?
Yeah , but it' s a nice place .
- So that comes to ... ?
- Ninety- seven , give or take .
He didn' t find us on his own .
- Someone helped him .
- Another thief .
Nobody we know would violate rule number one .
What we do know is we need a job .
We need a high- paying job .
We' re too hot to work anywhere in this country .
- So we go abroad .
How about we go ... ?
- We' re on the 5 : 00 .
Good .
Where are we going ?
- Amsterdam .
- Amsterdam it is .
- Clock' s running .
Let' s go .
- Never been to Amsterdam .
I hear German girls are really hot .
Rusty .
- Amsterdam ?
- Yeah .
Don' t tell Danny .
Hey , Rusty .
Rusty .
Sorry , sorry .
Hey .
What are you doing ?
What' s wrong with you ?
- Nothing .
- What ?
- Can I ... ?
Can I ... ?
- What ?
- Just for a second , can I talk to you ?
- What' s wrong ?
I just ...
I don' t know .
This might not be the perfect time or whatever to talk about it .
- Okay .
- I' ve been thinking .
I' ve been doing my homework .
And I' d really like ... ... to play a more central role this time around .
- Right .
- I feel like I' ve ...
- Right .
- I' m ready for that , and I ... way overdue .
I was wondering if I could come to the meeting and help you guys negotiate .
Okay .
It' s just a sit- down with Matsui .
He' s got his own language , this guy .
I watched you and Danny really closely last time around .
I learned a ton .
Linus , in my professional opinion , you' re not ready .
- Okay .
Yeah , I mean ...
- But ...
But ...
But ... ... if you' re convinced you are ready ... ... I can speak with Danny .
We can make this happen .
But you gotta be sure .
- Not sure ?
- No , I am .
- You' re sure ?
- But if I had a question , I could ...
- You would call me ?
- Right .
Okay .
Any time .
- Okay .
- Okay .
- All right .
- Okay .
Awesome .
Thank you .
Yeah .
I almost wasn' t gonna come over and say anything .
Then I' d still be sleeping .
- Thanks , buddy .
- Yeah .
- Who' s there ?
- Li ...
It' s ...
- what ?
- It' s Linus .
Is Rusty here ?
Rusty ... ?
- Do you know where Rusty is ?
- No .
So have you met Matsui ?
Seriously , what do you think of me ... ... you know , in terms of just leadership potential ?
The fact that we' re unemployable shouldn' t enter your mind .
Otherwise , you' re wasting time .
Don' t mention Benedict unless he does first .
And if he does , tell him everything .
Right .
Stay on point .
And don' t forget the other thing I told you .
- What ?
- About listening .
Relax .
Remember , if we don' t get this job , we' re dead .
Rusty , I tried calling you all yesterday .
So finally , she slams her vodka tonic down on the tray and says :
" Hey , maybe that' s why I' ve been feeling so warm recently . "
Yeah .
- So to business ?
- To business .
A doctor who specializes in skin diseases ... ... will dream he has fallen asleep in front of the television .
Later , he will wake up in front of the television ... ... but not remember his dream .
Would you agree ?
If all the animals along the equator were capable of flattery ... ... then Thanksgiving and Halloween ... ... would fall on the same date .
Yeah .
Hey .
When I was 4 years old ... ... I watched my mother kill a spider with a tea cozy .
Years later , I realized it was not a spider .
It was my Uncle Harold .
Is he all right ?
Are we all right ?
- " Kashmir " ?
- Is that your idea of making a contribution ?
- We hadn' t even started yet .
- We were this close to losing that .
Okay , I don' t even understand what happened in there .
What did I say ?
- You called his niece a whore .
- A cheap one .
- She' s 7 .
- Confined to bed with a case of ...
- No , don' t tell him about it .
- I' m sorry .
Okay .
So , what does this mean ?
It means you stay here .
- What are we after ?
- It' s a document .
It' s a very old , very valuable document .
- Yeah , what is it ?
- A stock certificate .
The first one ever issued from the first corporation on the planet .
Dutch East India Trading company .
- The only one of its kind .
- What' s the take ?
2 . 5 million euro .
Wait .
Each ?
- No .
- Who negotiated this ?
- That' s a lot of money to a lot of people .
- Are you out of your mind ?
If we do one job a week at that rate , we won' t pay Benedict off until ...
- September 2005 .
- Jesus christ , Danny .
I hear you , but it' s what' s available .
After we pull this job off ... ... Matsui' s gonna throw us another .
It' s gonna pay 10 times this one .
- Which will buy an extension from Benedict .
- You hope .
I hope .
Now , the good news is that Matsui gave us the system' s master code .
- So , what are we waiting for ?
- Van der woude .
- That' s the bad news .
- He never leaves .
- He' s agoraphobic .
- He' s never been out of his house ?
- Not in 10 years since he moved in .
- Does he believe in fresh air ?
- He opens his window .
- What does that mean ?
- Best time of arrival .
- Means he opens his window .
By the fourth movement , he' s out like a light .
So we go in at 3 a . m .
Okay , can we tap into the system from the phone lines ?
It' s a closed- loop system with two servers locked in titanium cases next to his bed .
- So hacking in is out .
- Look at this .
Telephone- repair truck , basket up to the second floor .
Telescoping rod through the window , tap out the freak' s code .
- Dumb idea .
One lane , one- way streets .
- Dumb idea .
All right ?
Any stoppage will bring cops .
The outside is covered by five surveillance cameras .
Monitored 24 hours a day by a security company .
He' s got five exterior cameras ?
- This guy is a freak .
- Super freak .
What about through the roof ?
- Two more cameras , pressure sensors ...
- A laser net over the trap door ...
- Smoke the freak out .
- Yeah .
- Smoke the freak out .
- Hey !
- What ?
- Do we have to use that term ?
- What term ?
- " Freak . "
The National Institute of Mental Health estimates 5 . 6 percent of adults ... ... develop " agraphoriaphobia . "
- Agoraphobia .
Whatever .
I' m just saying , I mean , do we ... ?
We don' t need to be an organization that labels people .
Oh , now we' re an organization ?
You' d call Emily Dickinson a freak ?
- Are you hosting a telethon ?
- Who' s Emily Dickinson ?
Am I the only one who feels funny about stealing from a ... ?
You know , a handicapped guy ?
- Well , I don' t care .
- Hell , yeah .
I feel funny about other things .
Cool .
But ...
- Yeah ?
- But ...
- Right .
- What ?
- Ahab with a piggyback .
Livingston ?
- I can get anything .
- It' s done .
- Ahab with what ?
- Boys .
- You' re making that up .
That' s ...
That whole " Ahab with a piggyback , " that' s not real ?
- Let me in .
- How do you think it feels ... ... when someone bangs on the door ?
- I gotta go to the toilet .
Otherwise , I' m gonna shit on your feet .
Come on .
Show me them specs .
I' ve been doing this since I' m 12 years old .
You' re micromanaging .
You gotta find people you can delegate to .
Otherwise , you' il never have a life .
I don' t want a life .
I want the hotel to run like a hotel should .
Reuben .
Yeah .
Great .
- Okay .
Good .
- Maybe .
Fantastic .
Sure .
" Look into your heart . "
I cry every time .
What ?
We have no line of sight .
Our only possibility , the window .
We' re three inches too high .
There' s no clear shot , even with Basher .
In the physical universe we occupy , it cannot be done .
What about the guy from the Bulgari job ?
- Nagel .
Spoke with him .
- Anything ?
Lot of ideas , none of them any good .
He' s pushing this new holographic technology .
Really interesting stuff , though .
He can reproduce anything 3- D.
How about 97 million ?
We' re forcing it .
Yeah , we' re forcing it .
- You know what we haven' t thought of ?
- What ?
We turn ourselves in .
- What could Benedict do to us then ?
- There you go .
Call the cops , tell them we did the Bellagio job .
They put us away for 20 years .
That' d teach him .
I think Tess would stick around .
You look great in jumpsuits .
Hey ... ... how' s the hotel business ?
- Sucks .
- How' s East Haven ?
- Sucks .
I don' t know .
Can' t turn my brain off , you know .
It' s me .
We go into some place , and all I can do is see the angles .
It' s what I do .
It' s what I' ve always done .
I love it .
I don' t know .
Some sort of weird irony , you know ?
Tess watching me scratch and itch .
Hey , listen .
You know , the world' s gone nuts and you' re ...
Schumann did it in ' 64 in venice and ' 73 in Istanbul .
We cut them , insert the jacks and crank away .
It' s really our best plan , considering it' s our only plan .
What ?
Oh , oh , okay , hold on .
Try that .
Number five .
I' m a go .
Master thieves who practice the long con live separate lives as civilians .
They have legitimate jobs and families ... ... which make them extremely difficult to catch .
The greatest thief of all time was , without question ... ... Gaspar LeMarc , who either died in Portugal in 1988 ... ... or in Hong Kong in 1996 , or he' s still alive .
We may never know for certain , because LeMarc ... ... was never captured or photographed ... ... despite being active for over 50 years .
Though he left behind a slew of imitators ... ... only one is worth mentioning in the same breath as LeMarc :
The thief we know only as the Night Fox .
So named for the small onyx figurines he leaves behind to taunt us ... ... the Night Fox must be considered our number- one priority .
His string of high- profile crimes are an embarrassment to our branch ... ... to our entire profession .
We need more than traditional resources to pursue thieves like the Night Fox .
We need to train ourselves to think the way they think , to see what they see .
And we should not allow ourselves to be distracted ...
I' m sorry .
Someone just robbed the van der woude house .
What ?
Hi , Isabel .
Well , we could really use your help on this one .
I hope the scene hasn' t been contaminated .
When can I speak to Mr. Van der woude ?
Probably tomorrow .
He' s heavily sedated .
We can' t figure out how they disabled the alarm .
Shorted it out somehow ?
No , that would have triggered the system and damaged the circuits .
Well , then .
Then I don' t know how they got in .
They had the code .
Someone other than the owner must have known it .
Impossible .
Van der woude programmed the last nine steps of the system .
He set it and never left the house again .
Closed loop .
Redundant servers .
Titanium encasement .
It' s not bad , actually .
Yeah .
Thanks .
Do we know each other ?
- I think I saw you yesterday .
- Oh , yeah ?
Yeah , you were being chased by the police .
Chasing me ?
No .
I don' t think so .
No , I love Rome .
I love it .
But there' s an opening at work the level above me , and it' s ...
I was thinking I was gonna try out for it .
It' s in Amsterdam .
My mother has family there , so it' d be ...
It' d be good .
What is it ?
It' s where the crossbow bolt hit .
The crossbow bolt ?
They fired from that rooftop through this open window .
With a crossbow bolt from that roof through that window ?
- That' s a very difficult shot .
- No , it is an impossible shot ... ... until they raised the building .
Check the pylons .
They' il be elevated .
- You know the name Max Schumann ?
- No .
- Well , they do .
- Who ?
The Americans .
Exactly .
Why would they bring the drill if they weren' t planning to use it ?
- What ?
- Oh , God .
- What ?
- I don' t know .
How does this guy know who we are ?
That' s the guy who dimed us to Benedict .
I find that hard to believe .
And you are ?
The Night Fox .
Okay , Mr. Night Fox .
Nothing ?
Who do you think you' re dealing with ?
Nothing costs nothing .
And this information is definitely worth something .
How so ?
Restraint ?
That' s asking a lot .
What else ?
Two weeks ?
I can live with that , even if they can' t .
For letting them live ?
Everything they stole , plus interest .
A lot of interest .
Of course .
Fair ?
I certainly hope not .
So , what about the information ?
He was here .
Around 3 : 30 this morning .
I can tell .
- Who ?
- The Night Fox .
Go down to the Dampkring and pick up a guy called Matsui .
What is he doing ?
Get him out of there .
God .
Hello , Frank .
I can' t understand what we did to this guy .
- Why does he have it out for us like this ?
- How did he get that code ?
Doesn' t matter .
He broke rule number one .
He' s on the list .
Great time for a turf war .
I spoke with Frank' s associate in Dublin .
She' s trying to get us a name on this guy .
Our train leaves tomorrow at 1 : 38 , okay ?
- Where is Frank ?
- I don' t know .
It' s gonna get out .
Then we' il be dead , and no one will wanna work with us .
Housekeeping .
Turndown service for Mr. Ryan .
Hi .
Nice room .
You have it all to yourself ?
You here to take me in ?
Why would I do that ?
It' s not as if you stole something .
It' s nice to see you again , Robert .
You too .
Of course , you' ve been seeing plenty of me , haven' t you ?
I like this one .
I call it " thief à la mode . "
Schumann Special , huh ?
I guess that' s what I get for opening my mouth .
So , what about the Night Fox ?
Did he leave you a message ?
What about the figurine ?
You still have it ?
I suppose it' s a compliment in a way .
I guess he' s threatened by you , though I can' t imagine why .
You have no idea what you' re up against .
The French police think he' s better than LeMarc .
Well , he is French .
Let me give you some advice .
Find out how you offended him .
Apologize .
Beg for mercy .
Got to go .
Any message for Frank ?
He' s been hanging around the station .
On what charge ?
Well , we found a print of a size 14 Hi- Tec Magnum boot at the crime scene .
And ?
Bought with a fraudulent credit card .
From that point on , well , there' s only one , maybe two great nail salons in Amsterdam .
- And you lied to us .
- Yeah , and to me .
Well , Frank knew .
- Frank knew you were in touch ?
- I wasn' t in touch .
I was more like keeping tabs .
- She' s a cop !
- Detective , actually .
- Where' d she learn all that Schumann crap ?
- Dad .
- What , he was a cop ?
- Thief .
- Oh , God .
Was he good ?
- Oh , yeah .
Great .
Pissed- off ex- girlfriend whose thief father ... ... taught her every trick in the book .
Well , she just made Danny and Yen .
In the next 48 hours , your pictures will be in every police station .
- Nobody looks at them .
- Nobody but cops .
- Detectives .
- You' d think she' d have sympathy for us ... ... if her old man was a thief .
- Is that sympathy or empathy ?
No , her old man got popped a day before her 9th birthday .
Died in jail .
So I wouldn' t count on much sympathy .
Or empathy .
She' s gonna have the hotel under surveillance .
Great .
We' il just eat room service , watch movies and wait for Benedict to kill us .
- Who' s on the $100 bill ?
- Adams .
- John Travolta .
- He said every problem ... ... is an opportunity in disguise .
He couldn' t say that with a . 45 in his mouth .
No , you' re missing the silver lining here .
Now , she gave us a name , didn' t she ?
The Night Fox .
One phone call , we' re gonna find out everything there is to know about this guy .
The name is M. Diaz .
D- l- A- Z.
It' s a black duffel bag .
The team' s in Rotterdam .
The bag' s in Brussels .
He' s the modern man :
Disconnected , frightened ... ... paranoid , but with good reason .
It' s too sad to be funny .
Unusable .
- I think I can get 20 minutes out of it .
- Great .
I got it .
The team' s in Barcelona .
The bag' s in Madrid .
This is a moral issue we' re dealing with here .
And we don' t have a grease man anymore , because he' s in a bag somewhere .
We got a bag man .
Such an ape .
An animal with no feelings .
- I have feelings .
- No , you don' t .
I feel bad for the guy .
He' s in a piece of luggage , but he' s got water .
- What did you want them to do ?
- Get off the bus .
And pick up the bag with our friend in it .
How many pro soccer teams are fielding 50- year- old men ?
Rusty' s not 50 years old .
Yeah , dude , we know Rusty' s not 50 .
You think I' m 50 years old ?
Let me ask you something .
No , wait , let me ask you something .
How old do you think I am ?
Forty- eight .
You think I' m 48 years old ?
Fifty- two ?
- Maybe he should' ve asked me .
- Nobody should ever ask you anything .
That guy doesn' t have a hard enough life right now ?
You gotta ...
You' re gonna defend him ?
They put Yen in a handbag .
- Can I ask you something ?
Ever notice ... ?
- Lf you' re gonna ask a question ... ... give me time to respond , unless it' s rhetorical ... ... in which case the answer is obvious :
Yes .
- Okay , can I ask ... ?
- Yes .
- You ever notice that Tess looks exactly ... ?
- Don' t ever ask that .
Seriously .
- Not to anyone .
Especially not to her .
- Wait .
Why not ?
Look .
It' s not in my nature to be mysterious ... ... but I can' t talk about it , and I can' t talk about why .
- Can I ask you ... ?
Do I look 50 to you ?
- Yeah .
- Really ?
- Well , I mean , only from the neck up .
Nothing .
You wanna go out ?
It' s nice .
No .
You wanna watch something ?
The game' s on .
No .
- You hungry ?
I' il heat something up .
- No .
Saul , ever since you got back , you' ve been acting strange .
What did Danny want ?
Nothing .
Nothing ?
How could he want nothing ?
Mr. Ocean .
You broke rule number one , and that has consequences .
Oh , you must be talking about the paintings .
Don' t worry .
You' il be dead in five days , and I' il get my paintings back .
- Unless you have an accident first .
- I don' t think so , Daniel .
Perhaps I should explain to you why I' m tormenting you .
I' d like that .
Last month I was in Portugal to see my mentor .
- LeMarc .
- Indeed .
A very loud and annoying American businessman was there the same day .
I told LeMarc that you can' t be better than me .
And he answered that it was impossible to know for sure .
So I thought about that for , like , three weeks in a row , day and night .
And then suddenly , I realized that he was actually right .
It is impossible to compare one theft to the other .
So I guess the only way to know who' s the best of us for sure ... ... is to go after the same object .
Do the same job .
Don' t you think that would be fun ?
You' re being awfully cavalier with a lot of people' s lives so you can play out a game .
You' re gonna regret it .
Come on , Mr. Ocean .
How are you gonna possibly get $97 million by next wednesday ?
Especially if every safe you crack between now and then is already empty ?
Whereas if you accept my challenge and win ... ... I promise I' il pay your debt to Benedict ... ... and LeMarc will hold my money in escrow as a guarantee .
What are we stealing ?
- Rusty' s phone .
- Who is this ?
Nagel .
Where' s Rusty ?
Gunther' s ?
What' s that about ?
Did he say something ?
Yes , I do .
Tell him this thing is gonna cost him double what I told him .
And tell him I had to go three times as thin on the layers .
And tell him if he wants it tomorrow , it should cost him more than double .
And tell him this thing is beautiful .
And tell him I' m being a nice guy .
And tell him he dresses like a gigolo .
Yeah .
No .
Tell him having a sexy female assistant ... ... is such a terrible cliché .
Can I get a coffee or something ?
Thanks .
Just a cappuccino or espresso .
Well ...
Ryan and his friends did the Bellagio casino heist in 2001 .
Hey ...
Because LeMarc stole it in 1980 when 23 others failed .
Because the Night Fox is trying to prove he' s better than Ryan and his friends .
This is ridiculous .
You say the egg will be stolen .
Then you say LeMarc already stole it 24 years ago .
- Which one is it ?
- Both .
What ?
LeMarc' s wife made him put the egg back .
When I signed a 1077 for you on the Bulgari case ... ... you requisitioned 30 of my men for three months and made zero arrests .
I won' t do it again .
10 : 10 , I leave the café , proceed west .
10 : 11 ?
- I enter the second- floor bathroom .
- 10 : 13 ?
Approach the Spanish Steps from the south .
Basher and I enter by the main entrance .
- 10 : 15 ?
- I help Yen into the ventilation duct .
- 10 : 18 ?
- I move Reuben to the Egg Room .
- I pause in the Great Hall while ...
- I go to the Egg Room .
- 10 : 21 ?
- Yen enters the mainframe room .
He cuts power to grid 14- A.
He radios me .
I signal Linus .
- I then go to the Egg Room .
- 10 : 22 ?
I drop my keys and move Reuben to his mark .
- I blind camera one .
- I blind camera two .
- I blind camera three .
- Camera four .
- I make the switch .
- Right .
- 10 : 24 ?
- I pull to the corner of the main entrance .
I meet Danny at the Steps .
We head north .
10 : 25 ?
Turk and I make the drop .
All right .
Really good stuff , guys .
Really good work .
All right , we' il pick it up here in an hour .
It' s a slam- dunk .
- Great .
- 10 : 45 , we all get arrested .
You bet .
- How was Toulour ?
- He was predictable .
You hear from Nagel ?
He' il be here .
That' s a lot to presume from a guy like Nagel .
Follow it up .
This is Isabel .
Three thousand separate , translucent , digital slivers ... ... instead of the 1000 I thought it would be .
Thank God it doesn' t have to move .
Re- creating the lighting was a pain .
It' s a mixture of tungsten and real light .
