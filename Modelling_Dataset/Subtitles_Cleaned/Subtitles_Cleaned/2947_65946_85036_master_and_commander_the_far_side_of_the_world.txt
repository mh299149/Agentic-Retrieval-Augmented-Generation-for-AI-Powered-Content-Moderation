Good luck sir .
Good luck captain .
It give you joy .
Oh here we go again .
When you think its ready , it would be ready .
All that easy when we reach shore .
So many wounded .
Better than a doctor at all .
I met the doctor .
I meet a few months ago .
Did they ?
Mr Mold to the cabin .
That doctor gave me this sword .
Sir ?
Change the coast .
South east by east .
Yes , sir .
And within ..
Sir ?
Make the quarters .
Subject to the requirements of the surface .
Oh , Steven .
We are not going anyway .
