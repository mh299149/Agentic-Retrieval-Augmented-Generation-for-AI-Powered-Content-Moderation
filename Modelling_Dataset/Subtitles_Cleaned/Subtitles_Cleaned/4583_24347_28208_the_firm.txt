Stroke !
Stroke !
Pick him up , pick him up !
Son of a bitch !
I mean , Your Honour , good shot .
I`m currently doing an externship for extra credits as a clerk for Judge Hookstratten .
BJ Hookstratten ?
That`s more impressive than being in the top %% .
I don`t know offers you`ve had from WaII Street ...
The top % in my class , not the top %% .
I`m sorry ...
Mr McDeere , we`re offering you 68, 000 a year from the Ieading Iaw firm in Chicago .
- Where else do you have to be ?
- My job .
I`m on Iunch break .
I know you`ve had a Iot of offers , but we have 127 clients that are Fortune % 00 companies !
We`II offer you 74, 000 ... .. requirement for a first- year associate is only 2, 000 hours , not more .
We want you to have a Iife outside the office .
If you`re a Lakers fan , we have a box at the Forum .
I know other firms have been offering you everything .
But with your ability and ambition , the place for you is our firm .
Let`s not talk about the package ,
Iet`s talk about what`s in the package .
One partner is an ex- governor , two are congressmen .
One is a former secretary of agriculture ...
May I take your coat , sir ?
- MitcheII McDeere ?
- Yes .
Lamar Quinn .
Come on in .
I`d Iike you to meet Oliver Lambert - our senior partner .
This is Royce McKnight , our managing partner .
- Welcome .
Care for a drink ?
- I`m fine .
Take a seat , Mitch .
Tired of interwiews ?
No , sir .
I don`t quite know what to say .
UnusuaI for a Iawyer .
I can get tongue- tied in many situations , sir , but it`s usuaIly with my wife .
Would you mind describing one ... with your wife ?
The first time I saw her , anytime we argue , whenever she enters a room , as a matter of fact .
Might we ask about the rest of your family ?
My father was kiIled in the coaI mines , and my mother remarried and Iives in Florida .
Brothers and sisters ?
None .
Mitch , I hope you don`t think us intrusive but stability in the family has a speciaI importance for us .
Bendini , Lambert & Locke is just a smaII Memphis firm , 41 Iawyers .
But we`re a Iarge family , so we`re careful .
Now , sir ...
Do you have any questions ?
Do you have an offer in mind ?
It includes a bonus schedule , a Iow- interest mortgage so you can buy a home , country club membership , and we`II Iease you a new Mercedes .
You pick the colour , Mitch .
Lamar , you haven`t been paying attention .
His wife picks the colour .
- Do I ... do I open it here ?
- Of course .
Unless you can teII us what`s in it .
A Iawyer worth that offer shouldn`t have to open the envelope .
Mr McKnight , you are the managing partner at Bendini , Lambert & Locke ?
Did Mr Lambert as senior partner give you instructions regarding my employment ?
He did .
Mr McKnight , do you foIlow Mr Lambert`s instructions ?
Objection - vague , ambiguous .
Sustained .
What precisely were those instructions ?
That you were in great demand and I should make certain that we obtain your serwices before a bidding situation developed .
How did you go about making certain ?
I bribed a clerk in the Harward Law placement office for the exact amount of the highest offer and then added 20 % .
Mitch , the Ietter you got from Bendini , Lambert & Locke was the only one sent out .
We want you .
OK .
You`II have to Ieave now .
I`m expecting my husband .
To heII with him .
Come here .
Moo shoo pork , Szechwan beef , Mandarin duck ... from Wong Boys .
- It`s even got a cork .
- What`s going on ?
You remember the Ietter I got from that firm in Memphis ?
Memphis ?
That`s what I thought untiI their offer .
- What was the offer ?
- They didn`t say .
It`s there .
- It`s sealed .
- I guessed .
- What ?
- Yeah , but I`m a good guesser .
Plus a %% increase the second year .
- Why ? - ``Why`` ?
- Whose side are you on anyway ?
- Yours .
Plus bonuses , a Iow- interest mortgage .
A home with grass around it ?
They want to fly us down to Memphis for a visit .
Been in one Iimo , you`ve been in them aIl .
Bye .
See you Iater , Your Honour .
Hey , Mitch .
Come on .
Associates first , then Iunch with the partners in our private dining room .
He`s our number- one draft pick , so to speak , and he`s being romanced by the big boys from New York and Chicago and everywhere else , so we have to seII him on our Iittle firm in Memphis .
Meanwhile , he`s going to try not to be embarrassed while I teII you he`s graduating from Harward with honours .
No one`s divorced in the firm ?
- No one`s divorced in the firm .
- Impossible .
No bachelors , either .
- What about women ?
- They had one once .
Only one ?
Yeah , Alice Krauss .
Wobbled around on high heels .
Affirmative action on stilts .
AII white , aII male , aII married , huh ?
- What`s this ?
- There he goes .
It`s different from the Northeast .
The pace , we`re almost stately by comparison .
Courteous ...
And not as gossipy .
- We keep each other`s secrets .
- I Iike that .
What do you Iike about it ?
AII of it .
It`s a family .
Just the way you said .
I`ve been teaching in Boston at a private school .
Do you work ?
Not since I put Lamar through Iaw school .
- But working isn`t forbidden .
- Forbidden ?
- Working .
By the firm .
- How could it be forbidden ?
It isn`t .
Anyway , two babies in 14 months , was aII the work I could handle .
- You plan to start a family ?
- Maybe in a few years .
- The firm encourages children .
- How do they do that ?
- Hey .
How about it ?
- How about it !
OK .
The ``Love Boat`` band , the secret recipe ribs - they`re a Iittle square , but ...
I don`t mind square .
I Iike square .
Weird , I mind .
What do you mean , weird ?
Here`s a quote .
The firm doesn`t ``forbid`` me to take a job , and they ``encourage`` children .
Ask me why .
Because they love kids .
Because children promote stability .
- Want to hear more ?
- No .
You`re right .
I`m just going to throw myself over the rail .
- My wiII is self- explanatory .
- OK , OK , OK .
These are nice people , Abby .
OK , I`m more impressed than you are - you grew up with it .
6, 000 a year here is Iike 1% 0 in New York .
Did you ever think I`d make a six- figure salary ?
Absolutely .
You did ?
WeIl ... your folks are only a few hours away , too .
If we fight , I don`t have far to drive ?
Exactly .
She made two phone caIls from the hotel ... one to her parents and one to the Memphis schooI board .
She seemed a Iittle reluctant .
I`d hate to Iose this young man .
I think she`II come around .
What about Kozinski and Hodges ?
Have you spoken to Chicago ?
I have .
It`s not good .
We`II have to do something .
I drew the happy face , Mrs McDeere .
Where is Memphis ?
- Is that it ?
- It Iooks different .
It`s prettier than the pictures they sent .
``Mitch and Abby , we`ve taken the Iiberty ``of furnishing the house temporarily . ``Just a few things to make you feeI at home . ``
Abby !
Not bad , huh ?
Where`s yours ?
- Don`t get up .
- Don`t worry .
- MitcheII McDeere .
- Tad eager , are we , Mr McDeere ?
What are you doing ?
Dutch says you`ve been here since 6 : 30 .
I`m starting the bar exam work .
No associate`s ever failed it .
I`II show you your office .
WaIly Hudson , contracts .
Here to help with the exam .
- Thanks , WaIly .
- No associate`s ever failed it .
First day`s a four- hour multiple choice on ethics .
Look at the first six chapters .
I`II see you Wednesday , 8 : 4 % .
- No associate has ever failed .
- No kidding !
Ken Curry , domestic relations .
Mike HiIl , wiIls and estates .
Nina .
Fuck !
Please .
Sorry .
Can I help you ?
ActuaIly , I think I`m here to help you .
I`m Avery Tolar , your designated mentor .
Let`s go to Iunch .
Lunch ?
But it`s not even ...
Not even noon .
It`II be a working Iunch .
Come to my office while I drop this off .
BiIling includes how Iong you spend thinking about a client .
I don`t care if you`re in traffic , or shaving , or sitting in a park .
My particular field ...
Is forming Iimited partnerships through offshore corporations .
I want you to review the Iast one I did for a client named Sonny Capps .
Made 14 miIlion Iast year .
Paid 4 % in taxes and resents every buck .
But he paid us 400, 000 , so keep him happy .
Look at the deal .
Try coming up with something .
I`II caII him in the morning .
- Mr Tolar , should I save these ?
- Please .
- What do you mean ``anything`` ?
- What do you think ?
You`re the risk taker .
You think I`m talking about breaking the Iaw ?
- How far do you want it bent ?
- As far as you can .
So don`t risk an IRS audit ?
I don`t care .
They just better not win .
- Yes , Mr Tolar ?
- Something before Iunch ?
I should warn you , the firm frowns on drinking
- during office hours .
- Iced tea , please .
Bombay martini on the rocks , EIlis , three olives .
On the way .
Senator .
I`m aIlowed a few minor rebeIlions .
- Put that in the bedroom .
- I made some tea .
I`ve never had so many people doing things for me .
This is Southern hospitality .
Would you Iike speed diaIling ?
My husband`s office number ...
- Let`s see , that`s ...
- We have it , Mrs McDeere .
We do aII the instaIlations for the firm .
- What Ied you to Iaw school ?
- I can`t remember .
Sure you can , counseIlor .
I was a delivery boy for a pizza parlour .
One day the owner got a notice from the IRS .
He didn`t know much English , even Iess about withholding tax .
He went bankrupt , Iost his store .
That was when I thought of being a Iawyer .
In other words , you`re an idealist .
No tax Iawyer`s an idealist .
I Iost my job .
It scared me .
Being out of work ?
No .
What the government can do to anybody .
What about you ?
What Ied you to Iaw school ?
It`s so far back , I don`t think I can remember .
Sure you can , counseIlor .
I used to caddie for young Iawyers off from work on weekdays ... and their wives .
I`d Iook at those Iong tan Iegs and knew I had to be a Iawyer .
The wives had Iong tan Iegs , too .
EIlis , another martini , please .
So we`re not a couple of idealists ?
Heaven forbid .
- Hi .
- Hi .
I`II Iet Mrs Quinn know you`re here .
- Are you sure it`s today ?
- That`s what he told me .
Kay ?
There`s been ...
Marty Kozinski and Joe Hodges were kiIled .
We just got word about 20 minutes ago .
Did you meet them at the barbecue ?
- What happened , Kay ?
- We`re not sure .
They were diving off a boat on Grand Cayman , and then there was some kind of explosion on the boat .
Lamar ?
Marty was ...
His twin girls are a month older than our son .
I`m very sorry , Lamar .
By the way ...
Oliver wanted me to teII you ...
You shouldn`t be burdened with a student Ioan .
Excuse me ?
If you bring the papers by tomorrow , the firm wiII repay it for you .
Kay was scared .
What ?
She was upset .
There`s a difference between being upset and being scared .
- She was scared .
- Of what ?
- Do you know her that weIl ?
- Maybe not .
But I have spent a Iot of time with her Iately .
They have their own horses .
Two of them .
Quarter horses .
Does that make half a horse ?
Sorry .
.. and wipe away tears from our eyes .
In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit , amen .
Let us pray .
Lord , our God , you are always faithfuI and quick to show mercy .
Our brother Marty was suddenly and violently taken from us .
Come swiftly to his aid .
Have mercy on him and comfort his family and friends by the power and protection of the cross .
We ask this through Christ , our Lord .
Amen .
Let us go in the peace of Christ .
I`m just going to say goodbye to Oliver .
I`II catch up with you .
Mrs McDeere .
I`m Avery Tolar .
You`re the reason I see so Iittle of my husband these days .
He must be the most ambitious man in the world .
One of them .
I mean ... Ieaving you every day just to go off to work .
- I`m sure you could manage .
- Just teII me how .
Did you know them weIl , the men who died ?
Yes .
You must be overwhelmed with grief .
People grieve in different ways , Mrs McDeere .
Abby !
Hearsay .
Oh , shit .
- Is he in ?
- Yes , Mr Tolar .
HeII of a proposal , kiddo .
Just redraft this section on repatriation of offshore funds .
- I need it tomorrow .
- Tomorrow ?
I need another week .
Can`t have it , pal .
We are flying to the Caymans tomorrow
- to take on Sonny Capps .
- But the bar exam ...
It`II be here when you get back , kiddo .
ShaII I stay , Mr McDeere ?
Would you Iike a sandwich ?
No , I`m fine , Nina .
You go on home .
- Good night .
- Good night .
- So what`s good here ?
- I`m just having coffee .
I`m going with the steak sandwich .
Two steak sandwiches on roIls , please .
Two steak sandwiches on roIls .
You with Bendini , Lambert & Locke ?
Yeah .
How did you ...
Ah .
Sorry .
I`m just a Iittle ...
Looks Iike they`re working you to death .
They do that with new associates , I guess .
- I`ve just been with them ...
- Eight weeks .
Sorry , guys , I`m just a Iittle punchy .
That firm Iooks Iike a health hazard .
- The hours they make you keep .
- The work they make you do .
Kozinski and ... Hodges .
Bob Lamm and Alice Krauss .
That`s 4 dead Iawyers out of 41 in Iess than 10 years .
None of them over the age of 4 % .
Beats any Iife insurance tables I`ve ever heard about .
Who are you guys ?
Could we get those sandwiches to go , please ?
We`II probably see each other again .
The car wouldn`t start .
I got ... caught in this incredible accident ... 12 cars ...
Maybe 13 .
And there was a ... pregnant woman in one of them .
I helped deliver the baby .
It was a ...
It was a girl .
They said they`re going to name her Abigail .
Come on , Abby .
Why do you think I`m working Iike this ?
- I want you to have ...
- Wait a minute .
I never asked for anything except for us to be together .
I wanna give you everything you gave up to marry me .
Stop it .
It`s sweet .
It`s some kind of courtship , but I don`t need aII that .
Just bring me flowers sometime .
What were you working on aII night ?
Just ... you know , it`s ... just this stuff ...
Avery`s got me doing for the Cayman trip .
- Want to have some eggs ?
- I had some eggs .
Want to have some naked ?
You don`t even know what moves me about you , do you ?
Mitch , I know what you want , but it`s not for me .
It`s not even for you , and you know it .
It`s easy for somebody rich to talk about being poor
Iike it`s some bothersome fly you just wave away .
This isn`t about rich or poor .
It`s something that won`t get fixed with 10 Mercedes .
Hey , that`s not fair , Abby .
That`s not fair !
This is about a mother in a trailer park and a brother you pretend you don`t have .
Have a nice trip .
Just foIlow me and don`t over breathe .
What about Sonny Capps ?
Aren`t we under pressure ?
Tremendous pressure .
If we don`t dive before the bank , we can`t do it .
You can`t dive and then fly within 24 hours .
How can you dive so soon after the accident ?
We don`t know what happened to Kozinski and Hodges .
There was a plane crash Iast week .
We didn`t take a boat to the Caymans , did we ?
That`s ridiculous .
Let us sit down for five minutes .
Thank you .
Son of a bitch pays Iess than %% tax and wants to fire us .
The Hyatt .
This new plan is very aggressive , and it defers aII your tax Iiability for years .
You could start right away .
I`m sorry , sweetheart .
I can`t talk right now .
These taxes are only deferred , right ?
The future tax value is Iess than half their present value .
- Who says ?
- After the election ...
Are you teIling me who`s going to be president next ?
That would be valuable information .
Mr Tolar has a plan that ... that meets aII your needs , whoever`s in the White House .
- Let him teII me .
- He`s trying to .
- Are you his Iawyer or mine ?
- Neither one , sir .
- Why the fuck are you here ?
- Sonny ...
You`re not the firm`s only concern here .
We put you into deals with other clients who may be sensitive about exposing their relationships to outside attorneys .
You hear that , counseIlor ?
That`s a veiled threat .
If you`re talking about our friends in Chicago , they don`t make money when I pay you fees .
You do .
They make money being in business with me .
As Iong as they`re making money , they don`t care who does my taxes .
You don`t know me .
I`m a nice guy .
Lose me a miIlion bucks , I won`t break your Ieg .
Sonny ...
Let`s not get carried away .
What did I say ?
- What did I say ?
- It`s what you didn`t say .
What I didn`t say ?
What didn`t I say ? ``Thank you . ``
Mr Tolar`s schedule virtuaIly guarantees you zero tax with zero risk .
Your stock would be the face amount of the instalment .
The stock has no value but it`s offset against income .
You defer your tax in fuIl , even with a bankable LC .
- Deferred tiII when ?
- What do you care ?
It`s the best interest- free Ioan you`II ever get .
So the worst is I pay my taxes much , much Iater ?
No .
Next year they`re closing this Ioophole .
If you haven`t grabbed this proposal , you`II feeI you`ve been fucked with a dick big enough for an elephant to feeI it .
Do you know that for a fact ?
Hey , you Iike the word ``protege`` ?
I never had one .
You ever been one ?
I`m ``A`` , you`re ``B`` .
Right next door .
- Avery , who`s in Chicago ?
- We`II get to aII that .
To heII with it .
Clean up and come over .
You earned a good night out .
Mr Abanks , I don`t believe it was an accident .
Just think about it .
I Iost my son .
I`d have screamed bloody murder if something was wrong .
- You`re right .
I`m sorry .
- Nothing to bury , even .
Just a stone .
They never did find him or the other two .
What other two ?
The other two who split the charter .
Your friends and two other guys .
Lawyers ?
They were in swimsuits .
They paid cash .
- Were they American ?
- Could have been anything .
One was ... I don`t know , squat , heavy .
Other guy had Iong , blond hair ... almost white , with weird blue eyes .
- Mitch ?
- Yeah .
Grab a Red Stripe .
I`m a Iittle slow .
Take your time .
I`m trying to Iook as pretty as you , which I`m convinced I can .
It just takes me a Iittle Ionger .
Anything to munch on ?
Yeah .
There`s some stuff next to the fridge .
It`s got a Iock on it .
Use that key I gave you .
- Do you see it ?
- Yeah , sure .
Did you find something ?
Listen , Capps is a tough guy , but he`s also a blowhard .
He Ioves to give the impression that he`s connected .
He thinks it`s glamorous .
He said a couple of things .
You`re about to take the bar exam .
Here`s a multiple choice ...
The difference between tax avoidance and tax evasion is : ``A`` , whatever the IRS says , ``B`` , a smart Iawyer , ``C`` , 10 years in prison , ``D`` ... aII of the above !
Being a tax Iawyer`s got nothing to do with the Iaw .
It`s a game .
We teach the rich how to play it so they can stay rich .
The IRS keeps changing the rules so we can keep getting rich teaching them .
It`s a game ...
One you just played very , very weIl .
Where`s your beer ?
I decided to wait for the rum .
- I hear it`s good down here .
- Everything is .
Taste it aIl .
I think that since we`re here on this island , there`s things we can do on it ... primitive things .
Come on , you deserwe it .
Look , this isn`t going to happen .
TeII my friend I went back to the condo .
You don`t know what you`re missing .
Thanks , anyway .
Are you aII right ?
It`s OK .
Just wait a minute .
Wait a minute .
Can I Iook at this ?
- You`re not a doctor .
- No , but I`ve ...
I`ve sprained a Iot of ...
I`ve sprained a Iot of ankles .
Mostly mine .
You should ...
You should ice this .
You should also report that guy .
That was your boyfriend .
That was for money .
- Aren`t you going to finish ?
- I`m sorry .
- You think that`s ...
- It`s nothing to do with me .
- Is this too tight ?
- No .
I work in a traveI agency .
I wanted to feeI Iike aII those people ... with first- class tickets and pretty clothes .
I guess ... I wanted to feel ... rich .
How much would it take to feeI rich ?
I don`t know .
How much would it take to feeI safe ?
You did that .
You made me feeI safe .
WiII you stay with me for a while ?
Why don`t you take the afternoon off ?
You deserwe it .
Spend it with that pretty wife of yours .
Oh , shit , I forgot .
She phoned Iast night .
What did you teII her ?
That you were probably walking on the beach .
I was .
I guessed right , then , didn`t I ?
OK , Mr McDeere .
Just sign where the ``X`` is , and initiaI where it`s marked .
The man from ``Gentlemen`s Quarterly`` .
How you doing , Ray ?
Pretty fair .
How`s yourself ?
It`s a Iong time , huh ?
It`s OK .
I`ve become a patient man .
Don`t beat yourself up , kid .
If I wasn`t here , I wouldn`t want to be here , either .
- You ever talk to Ma ?
- A few months ago .
- StiII with the same guy ?
- They`re aII the same guy .
So ...
You finish Iaw school ?
Yeah .
That suit`s a dead giveaway .
You get a job on WaII Street ?
You always said ...
No , I`m not .
I just ...
I went with a firm across the river in Memphis .
- Memphis ?
- Hey , Ray ...
Wouldn`t it be funny if I went to Harward , you went to jail , and we both ended up surrounded by crooks ?
Sonny Capps is thriIled .
McDeere was dazzling .
We should puII Lamar out of that tax seminar and send Mitch instead .
Let him take the jet .
- Any problem with that , BiIl ?
- No , no .
No problem .
So far the kid`s been reaI predictable .
If you`re even half right , you`II need help .
- What does Abby think ?
- I haven`t told her .
I guess ...
I guess I don`t want it to be real .
Nothing`s reaI untiI I teII it to Abby .
How`d you ever Iand the job with a brother in the joint ?
That`s OK .
I`d have done the same thing myself .
You were always around for me , Ray ... aII those years after Dad died .
I`d have done the same .
You think I teII guys around here my brother`s in Harward ?
Jesus , Ray .
Iisten , I want you to see a friend of mine .
His name`s Eddie Lomax .
He`s a private investigator in Little Rock .
Ex- cop .
Anything I can do for you ?
Sure .
Get me out of here .
Where to ?
Anywhere I can see a whole Iot of sky .
I can get through the days - I even eat the food .
It`s amazing how much you miss the sky .
Ever plug one of these in , and forgot to put the water in ?
No .
- You know what happens ?
- No .
The Iights go out .
He`s been dying to see you .
- Tammy !
- Mr Lomax wiII see you now .
Mitch McDeere .
I practicaIly went to Iaw schooI with you .
Ray talked about you every day for three years .
I was his ceIlmate .
Did he teII you it was statutory rape ?
She was 17 , Iooked 2 % .
I got one to four .
Sit down .
Come on , sit down .
Want some Sweet `n`Low ?
Dairy cream ?
No .
I ...
I`ve got some business I`d Iike to go over with you .
- I`m Ieavin` .
- Thank you , dear .
That`s my secretary .
She is terrific .
Her husband`s a nut case .
He`s a truck driver .
He moved here to be close to Graceland .
He thinks he`s Elvis .
His name is Elvis .
Elvis Aaron HemphiIl .
I`ve run across some strange things , some things I would never spray- paint on an overpass .
Now ...
What can I do for you ?
- What a nice surprise .
- Avery .
They didn`t have to disturb you .
- Believe me , it`s no bother .
- I was just Iooking for Mitch .
Nina says he hasn`t been in aII afternoon .
I didn`t mean for her to caII you .
Didn`t he come back with you ?
I`II be honest with you .
This is not my area of expertise .
But you think it`s possible .
Anything`s possible .
I`II teII you one thing .
If those guys were feds , you better watch out .
They don`t give a damn about you .
I get some pretty pissed- off husbands in here .
On the other hand , the Iawyers at your firm sure as heII seem accident- prone .
I`II see what I can find out .
You better Iet me caII you .
You sure remind me of your brother .
Ray comes up for parole in a while .
He says that , he can Iast it .
What do you think ?
There`s guys that can do aII the hard time the state gives them .
Whatever Ray had , he used up to get this far .
- Hi .
- Hi .
- I didn`t think you were home .
- Why not ?
- No car .
- Took it in for serwice .
Avery brought me home .
Went to the office Iooking for you .
- I wasn`t there .
- Apparently not .
I even Iooked under your desk .
Avery told me you were at MSU Iaw Iibrary .
- Avery did .
- Avery did .
I spotted your car in the parking Iot .
It made him edgy .
Avery didn`t exactly know where I was .
Probably thought you were with another woman .
I went to see Ray .
Just Iike that , after aII this time .
You`re right .
I`ve been stupid .
I would have gone with you on Saturday .
God , I just wasn`t ...
I wasn`t thinking .
- How`d it go ?
- It was ...
It was ...
God , he ...
He tried to make it easy for me .
Is he OK ?
He`s got to get that parole .
You want to try something ?
Let`s put the books away , pretend we`re back in our old , beat- up apartment , broke , and we find some money we forgot in pockets .
We`II send out for pizza .
Drink beer .
And watch ``Star Search`` .
Who knows where it wiII Iead ?
- Your wife .
- She`s in Cleveland .
She Iies .
Don`t you answer your phone ?
Don`t you knock ?
Where`s your secretary ?
Out .
- She Ieft a cigarette burning .
- She does that .
Come back in one hour and make an appointment .
Why bother ?
We`re here .
- I`m busy .
- Doing what ?
I`m getting a pedicure .
What`s it to you ?
This is going to turn out badly for you , but we can make it relatively painless .
Why are you asking questions about dead Iawyers ?
What dead Iawyers ?
Who hired you to do that ?
OK .
OK .
Just Iet me think .
His name ...
Was Julio Iglesias .
No !
No !
Great .
Just great .
You want to ask him a few questions now ?
This is a carefuIly balanced proposal .
I think it`s high- minded , but I think it`s fair- minded .
In other words , it`s got something to offend everyone .
If you want to foIlow along , we`II begin on page ``I . ``
We`II review sections 704- B of the IRS code of 186 ...
`` .. with partners` interests in the partnership - ``unless those aIlocations satisfy the economic effect ``most easily satisfied by taking advantage ``of the safe harbour provisions set forth therein . ``
So , in an ever- changing sea of tax Iaw ...
Watch your step , please .
Hey , brother .
Sister .
Brother , go down the steps towards the pool .
Here you go , brother .
- Voices from the waIl .
- Thanks a Iot .
Who kiIled Eddie Lomax ?
Go over and sit next to the man on the bench .
I appreciate your coming , Mr McDeere .
I`II caII you Mitch if I may .
My name is Denton Voyles .
I`m with the Department of Justice .
What happened to Eddie Lomax ?
We`ve been investigating Bendini , Lambert & Locke for four years .
No Iawyer has ever Ieft your Iaw firm alive .
Two tried to Ieave - they were kiIled .
Two were about to try - you know what happened .
We have reason to believe that your house is bugged ... your phones are tapped , and your office is wired .
They may have foIlowed you to Washington as we speak .
Are you saying that my Iife ...
Your Iife as you know it is over .
Your Iaw firm is the representative of the Morolto crime family in Chicago , known as the Mafia , the Mob .
I don`t believe it .
They set up Iegitimate businesses with money from drugs , prostitution ... aII cash moved offshore .
You believe it .
That`s why you talked to Thomas Abanks .
That`s why your private investigator got kiIled .
Maybe 30 % of their clients are Iegitimate .
They bring in a new rookie , throw money at him , buy the car , the house .
Once your kids are in private schools , you`re used to the good Iife , they teII you the truth .
You mean every partner in the firm ...
Every partner knows .
We suspect most of the associates .
Why don`t you get indictments and bust it aII up ?
We have to have somebody on the inside .
We need to see copies of contracts , clients` bank records , articles of incorporation .
Wait .
You think I`m ...
You can say no , but we`re going to break this firm .
When that happens , you`re going to jaiI along with the rest .
It`II happen .
Believe me .
Why can`t I just Ieave ?
That`s what Kozinski and Hodges were trying to do .
You have to think this over .
Meanwhile , you and your wife have to behave as though everything is normal .
Don`t discuss this with anyone ... but make a decision .
You help us , we`II make it worth your while .
- Worth my while ?
- You`II stiII have a good Iife .
You mean , in a witness protection programme ?
How ?
I Iive somebody else`s Iife in some nowhere place , and one day , I`m backing out of the driveway and my car explodes ?
Doesn`t have to be that way .
I don`t need much of a Iife but it has to be mine .
You got that now ?
Get back to the seminar .
Tarrance wiII negotiate on our behalf .
Why don`t you wander back past the Memorial ?
CaII me anytime , day or night .
The second one`s a mobile number .
Let me get this straight .
I steaI files and turn them over to the FBl , testify against my coIleagues , send them to jail .
ReveaI privileged information that violates attorney/ client confidences , get disbarred , then testify against the Mafia .
- Unfortunately ...
- Let me ask you something .
Are you out of your fucking mind ?
How Iong before they find out
Lomax`s ceIlmate was named Ray McDeere ...
And when they do , what wiII they do to him ?
They can get to anyone , anywhere .
- What can you do ?
- Your brother`s up for parole .
You cooperate with us - the board wiII be grateful .
Otherwise ...
You know what parole hearings are Iike .
It could go either way .
Forget about home .
Take me to the firm .
I need to see everybody , now .
- I`m on overseas , and ...
- Right now .
I just had a chat with the FBl .
- They didn`t try to coerce you ?
- No .
- They didn`t offer you money ?
- Nope .
Did they ask you to contact them ?
What for ?
Exactly what did they want ?
The secret files .
Who had those secret files Iast ?
Did you , Royce ?
I gave them to you .
They also suggested that Hodges and Kozinski were murdered .
Those sons of bitches .
Now we ought to build a case and sue .
This is pure harassment .
And that was it ?
That was everything that was said ?
WeIl , as far as I can remember .
It wasn`t exactly a sequentiaI conversation .
There was a Iot of yeIling , mostly by me .
Mitch , we`re always fighting the government .
If it isn`t the Justice Department , it`s the IRS .
We`ve beat them every time , and they hate us for it .
They can`t get to us , so they pick on somebody new .
They invite you to break the Iaw .
It doesn`t cost them anything , but it costs you everything .
I don`t want you to worry about this .
It`s gotten serious enough .
We`II have to get into it IegaIly .
The only other question is who do we biII this hour to ?
How about the FBl ?
I can`t believe that .
That is so weird .
I was just thinking about you .
Somebody`s burning Ieaves outside .
Did you smeII it ?
Reminded me of the time ...
If you`re afraid you`II wake the kids , we don`t have any .
Don`t say anything .
Don`t teII me any more .
Everything ...
Every single thing we`ve said or done since we`ve been in that house , nothing has been between us .
Can`t we just drive back to Boston tonight ?
- They`II find us .
- How do you go to work ?
- What do you say to Avery ?
- I talk about work .
That`s insane !
I`ve thought of every way here , in the Caymans , in Washington - that`s aII I`ve done .
If we run , they`d find us , and it gets Ray kiIled .
- But if you testify ...
- The FBI wiII protect us .
Protect what ?
What are you going to do ?
Go in tomorrow and start to copy files .
I don`t have a choice .
Mitch ...
What are you saying ?
You`II be revealing clients` secrets .
You`II be disbarred - unable to practice Iaw again , everything you`ve worked for .
- They can`t ask you to do that .
- They are not asking !
We have to behave exactly as we have been .
We have to go to work and come home every day and never wonder about the waIls and the wires ...
And do nothing we want to do .
Szechwan beef from Wong Boys .
That was the Iast time I remember Iaughing .
Come on .
Every single day you`re blocking this aIley .
Leave me alone .
You`re using this place as a parking Iot .
What the heII are you doing ?
Jesus , I was trying to make a copy .
Now you have to have the biIling code for each client .
Every time I copy a piece of paper , it`s recorded ?
Are you trying to kiII yourself ?
Come on .
Nina should do that .
Come down for one night , can`t you ?
Yeah , weIl , it used to be worth it .
OK .
WeIl ...
Yeah .
Maybe next time .
Bye , Cordelia .
- That was Cordelia .
- Your wife .
From the song of the same name .
Avery , about those Capps LCs ... when`s the next Cayman trip ?
For me ?
Next week .
If you think I`d Iet Sonny Capps see you again , you`re crazy .
But write down your thoughts .
I`II be happy to take credit .
Mr MulhoIland`s caIled twice about his biIls again .
TeII him to take it and ...
Wait a minute .
- Isn`t he just up the street ?
- Yes .
In The Cotton Exchange .
I`II see him Iater .
Did you order a fried egg sandwich ?
A fried egg ...
Yes , I did .
I did .
Come in .
It`s 2 . 6 % .
The receipt`s in the bag .
The receipt`s in the bag .
How did you see them and they didn`t see you ?
I was under the desk .
I was vacuuming .
You want me to draw you a diagram ?
I loved him .
I`m sorry , Tammy .
They wanted to know who hired him and why he was asking questions about them Iawyers .
You actuaIly saw them ?
One guy was stocky , Iooked Iike a wrestler .
He`s going to Iimp the rest of his Iife `cause Eddie hit him in the knee with that cannon under his desk .
Other guy was Iike an albino .
Long , thin hair ... almost white .
Dead blue eyes .
My Iandlady said they came Iooking for me yesterday .
So I checked into a moteI - couldn`t think where else to go .
They`re going to put Eddie together with Ray .
When they do , it`II Iead to you .
I don`t want anything bad to happen to you .
Eddie wouldn`t Iike it .
You`re in trouble Iike me .
There`s a building nearby caIled The Cotton Exchange .
Maybe you can help .
Hi there , Mitch .
BiII Devasher ... firm security .
Mr Locke and Mr Lambert told me about your run- in with the FBl .
Could we have a talk ?
ActuaIly , I told them everything .
Sure .
This won`t take a minute .
Hop in .
So , Mitch , this is a debriefing .
I know pretty much what you told the feIlas , so I kind of got the picture .
It`s my job to give you the picture .
What I`m concerned about , son , is this ...
The FBI figured they`d get to you .
- What made them think that ?
- I have no idea .
WeIl , see I have an idea that they know how important your wife is to you .
- They might use that .
- How ?
Avery says Iast Friday you took the afternoon off .
He figures you might have been with another woman .
Why would Avery think ...
How do you know you weren`t foIlowed ?
Here`s your Abby , one day walking to the mailbox , anticipating the arrivaI of her ``Redbook`` or ``Sharper Image`` catalogue .
What does she find instead ?
She finds heartache , Mitch ... the death of love and trust .
Imagine her one day opening that .
Go ahead .
Take a Iook .
Devastating .
Not just screwing , Mitch .
But the kind of intimate acts , oraI and what not , that could be particularly hard for a trusting young wife to forgive and impossible to forget .
That`s just the kind of stuff the FBI could use for coercion .
So you watch yourself .
I`II try to protect you , and I know you`II do your best to protect the firm .
So if the FBI so much as spits in your direction ,
Iet me know before it hits the ground , won`t you ?
Won`t you , Mitch ?
Oliver wants to see you in the Iibrary .
Where you been ?
Let me just put my coat away .
Right now .
He`s been waiting .
You think you`re smart , huh ?
We`ve been informed there`s somebody smarter .
You didn`t get the highest score on the bar exam .
You got the second highest score .
Cheers .
Nice going .
Congratulations .
They caIled you , huh ?
Guilty , Your Honour .
I did it .
WeIl , it`s your moment of glory .
You know , my wife missed mine , and ... she never forgave herself .
I wouldn`t want that to happen to you .
That`s very considerate , Avery .
WeIl , I thought so .
- WeII done .
- Quite an achievement , Mitch .
The space is great .
I`II take it .
And the Iease would be under ... ?
Greenwood SecretariaI Serwices .
- And you are ?
- Doris Greenwood .
I Iike that suit a Iot .
They`re going to deliver a copier tomorrow .
I`II make sure the office is open .
I wiII employ such means only as are consistent with truth and honour .
I wiII employ such means only as are consistent with truth and honour .
I wiII maintain the confidence and preserwe inviolate the secrets of my client .
I wiII maintain the confidence and preserwe inviolate the secrets of my client .
I wiII truly and honestly conduct myself in the practice of my profession to the best of my skiII and ability , so help me God .
I wiII maintain the confidence and preserwe inviolate the secrets of my client ?
The first thing I`m going to do is violate the secrets of my clients .
Do you see any other way ?
OK , then .
Aren`t we doing the best we can ?
No .
What do you mean ?
I can`t ...
What ?
That ...
That night ...
That night in the Caymans when you telephoned ...
You were on the beach .
What ?
What did you do ?
No .
You didn`t .
- Who was she ?
- I don`t know .
You don`t know ?
I don`t even know her name .
It didn`t mean anything .
Like heII it didn`t .
It means everything .
What did you do ?
Why did you fuck some stranger on a beach one night away from me ?
Who does that ?
- Abby , I promise you ...
- What ?
You can`t promise anything .
Not ever .
Not anymore .
Why did you teII me ?
Because I couldn`t stand not to .
I couldn`t stand ... your not knowing .
WeIl , now I know .
Give me the keys .
- Wait .
- Give me the keys .
I thought there were only two brothers Grimm .
Sit down , Avery .
Anthony and Joey are coming down next week .
- What for ?
- Your protege`s got a brother .
So ?
He didn`t mention him at the interwiew in Boston .
I got a brother I might not mention either ...
- This brother`s doing time .
- How do you know ?
What am I , a fucking watchman ?
- I get confused .
- WeIl , don`t .
AII right , Avery .
We got a prison guard in Arkansas .
He teIls us about a Ray McDeere doing time for manslaughter .
The Moroltos been edgy since the Kozinski and Hodges mess .
They think we`re misreading McDeere .
The Moroltos are coming to take over ?
- Are we misreading him ?
- I don`t think so .
Wouldn`t you Iie to get a job Iike this ?
We ought to keep him on a tight Ieash .
Why ?
You`ve got nothing to be suspicious about .
I get paid to be suspicious when I got nothing to be suspicious about .
Excuse me .
You`re not Iistening .
I`m sorry .
You were talking about hours ?
Listen ...
I know I`m not Bendini- Lambert`s most valuable client , but I`ve got a Iegitimate complaint .
You never spent 33 hours Iast month on my account .
- That`s what you were biIled ?
- You don`t see your biIls ?
No , I just ... just submit my time sheet .
Where is it ?
It`s on file with the office manager .
You know , this overbiIling`s gotten so common , nobody gives it a thought .
It`s kind of Iike tipping .
WeIl ...
It`s not policy , Mr MulhoIland .
It sure seems Iike policy .
It`s been going on over there for years .
People forget something else , too .
When somebody over there stamped this and mailed it , you know what happened ?
It became a federaI offence .
You`re damn right .
Each instance , punishable by ... 10, 000 fine .
Three to five years , each instance .
Nina , I`m going over to MulhoIland`s for a half hour or so .
AII righty .
- Wait a minute .
- I got the beeper .
There`s a way of doing this without getting disbarred
- or breaking the Iaw .
- Is that our chief concern ?
Tear those up .
I might not have to use them .
But I got to get that stuff in the Caymans .
- What ?
For the FBl ?
- No , for me .
They won`t Iet you go , you said .
Somebody`s going to have to get to it another way .
It has to happen fast .
I got to figure out what to do about Ray .
What ?
In ... in Eddie`s stuff , is there some kind of wireless recording device ?
- Yes .
- You can use it ?
Whenever Eddie said , ``My associate`` - yours truly .
Did he have any high- speed camera equipment ?
- Sure .
- And I want a van .
Tammy , did Elvis ever find out about Eddie ?
Oh , man .
He loved Eddie .
Are you kidding ?
HeIl , it was over between me and Elvis when I was 18 .
We`d been married two years , and one morning at breakfast ,
I just turned too old for him .
But everybody Ioves Elvis .
The man`s a panda .
He`d do anything for me .
They`re off .
Say Something comes away on top .
Right There`s on the inside .
Champagne rushes up .
Doesn`t the dog ever get the bone ?
Yeah .
When it happens they can never get that dog to run again .
Mr Voyles wants me to teII you how much the Bureau ...
A miIlion doIlars in an account in Switzerland .
IBG Bank InternationaI in Zurich .
You sure as heII turned greedy overnight .
And my brother out .
Now .
Your brother`s a convict , Mitch .
Then get yourself another snitch .
He`s in for manslaughter .
Bar brawl .
If he hadn`t boxed , would`ve been self- defence .
It`s stiII a felony , Mitch .
You heard me , Tarrance .
My brother out now .
And make it a miIlion and a half .
How about you kissing my ass for not indicting you as a co- conspirator , you cocksucker ?
I haven`t done anything .
Who cares ?
I`m a federaI agent .
Your Iife is mine .
I could kick you in without even violating your civiI rights .
You are agent Wayne Tarrance .
You`re God damn right I am .
Maybe IocaI cops can`t ...
- Yeah ?
- Wayne Tarrance ?
- Who is this ?
- Is this Wayne Tarrance ?
- Yeah , this is Wayne Tarrance .
- So is this . ``You cocksucker . `` ``I haven`t done anything , and you know it . `` ``Who cares ?
I`m a federaI agent . ``Your Iife is mine .
I could kick you in ``and I`m not even violating your civiI rights . ``
Now ...
I think you ought to reconsider .
I think I`ve found a way out .
Not out exactly .
It`s more Iike a way through .
It`s a Iong shot , but it`s ...
WeIl ...
It`s Iegal .
I know it`s weird , but if we foIlow the Iaw , it just might save us .
You don`t want to hear the plan .
Would it change anything between us ?
It`s just a plan .
I can`t do this anymore .
I can`t help you here .
I can`t help myself .
I`ve given notice at the school .
I`II Ieave on Wednesday .
You`re right .
It`s better if you go .
It`s safer .
- You have no idea .
- Don`t !
- I love you , Abby .
- Don`t you dare , sonofabitch !
- Wanna teII me your plan ?
- Tomorrow .
Abby , where are you going to go ?
To my parents .
Then I don`t know .
It`s not safe for you to Ieave unless they know why .
I know .
I know .
Somewhere ... inside ... in the dark ... the firm is Iistening .
ShaII we go and do this for the record ?
I`ve made a decision .
My mother hasn`t been weIl .
She`s having some tests .
I want to be there .
We never see each other anyway .
And I need some time to think .
CaII Devasher .
She`s Ieaving him .
Knock , knock .
Bad times , huh ?
Abby caIled Kay .
Listen ...
AII the wives go a Iittle nuts the first year .
She`II be back .
Probably want to get pregnant .
Big help , huh ?
You think I`II Iet this kid run the penaI system ?
Sir , it`s the only way he`II give us the files .
Then staII on the money , get the brother out with a subpoena , foIlow him , and when we get the files , yank him back .
- Abanks` Dive Lodge .
- Mr Abanks , this is McDeere .
I got to justify a client`s biII before a breakfast meeting .
AII the time sheets and biIls are with the office manager .
- I`m not supposed to do this .
- You want to wake up Avery ?
I`m just trying to head off a IegaI action against us .
I promise .
I`II have everything back in the drawer before the office opens .
You`re taIler than I thought .
That`s nice to hear .
There`s been a change of plan .
I didn`t know there was a plan .
Good , `cause it`s been changed .
Who are you , sweetheart ?
Abanks` Diving Lodge .
What time has Avery chartered the boat for ?
2 : 30 .
OK .
You got to keep him out Iong enough to copy everything .
My friends are taking him to Trinity Caves .
Should be a good six hours .
Tammy`s coming down tomorrow .
I can ...
I can whip us up some eggs .
Last day .
I don`t want to be Iate for school .
Has Tammy Ieft to meet Abanks ?
Not tiII this evening .
You`re running a three- ring circus .
- I hope it goes weIl .
- It has to .
You know , isn`t it amazing ?
You cheated , and I`m the one who feels guilty .
Don`t .
Take care .
There !
Hey , hey , hey , hey .
Hey , stop that .
Get back to the baII game .
You , too , Sheila .
Boys and girls together rehearsing for Iater Iife .
What are you doing here ?
Would you believe I happened to be in the neighbourhood ?
No .
I heard this was your Iast day .
Was I misinformed ?
I`II be gone for a while .
I just stopped off to say goodbye .
Just in case .
In case what ?
In case it`s more than a while .
I`m going to the Caymans tomorrow , and I would miss saying goodbye .
WeIl , thank you .
Have a nice trip .
Want to come ?
I know .
It sounds outrageous , but ... think about it .
We could grab some sun , take a dip ... drink some Havana Club .
I could give you maritaI advice and hit on you .
And whatever happens , I promise ,
I take rejection weIl .
What makes you think I need maritaI advice ?
- OK .
You give me advice .
- I couldn`t possibly .
- I don`t scuba- dive .
- I can`t scuba- dive either .
ReaIly ?
I`d heard that you don`t miss a chance .
Not this time .
I`ve shortened the trip .
A client`s coming into town .
I can`t dive and fly in the same 24 hours .
- So how about it ?
- My mother isn`t weIl .
They`re doing some tests .
That`s why I`m going home .
- I`m sorry .
I didn`t know .
- How could you possibly ?
I hope she feels better .
And if she does ... bring her with you .
Goodbye , Avery .
Have a good flight .
Greenwood SecretariaI Serwices .
Tammy , this is Abby McDeere .
You`ve got a problem .
Avery`s not going diving .
We`re dead .
WeIl ...
How do we ...
How am I gonna Iet Mitch know ?
I`m going anyway .
I gotta try .
My flight`s in three hours .
Mr McDeere`s office .
May I take a message ?
Tammy , don`t teII Mitch anything .
I`II just be a sec .
Prescription for AbigaiI McDeere .
One .
You want to go , or you want to stay here ?
- Aren`t you going to cuff him ?
- I`II take care of it .
Yeah ?
Guess what I`m Iooking at ?
TeII me .
My first sunset in six years .
- You made it ?
- Yeah .
Yeah , I did .
I owe you , Iittle brother .
No , you don`t .
Anything from Abanks ?
Last I heard , everything was set .
- It`s gonna be fine .
- It already is .
Be seeing you , Ray .
OK .
You`ve spoken .
Where are the files ?
Where`s the money ?
When I get the files .
You send half now .
Account number 614408- S.
- You got that ?
- Yeah .
614408- S. Yeah .
When it`s there , I`II send the files .
Here`s some money .
You`re free , McDeere .
There`s a bus stop a quarter mile .
FoIlow the yeIlow Iine .
You`re used to that .
Excuse me .
You don`t seem that surprised .
I`m deeply surprised .
So am I.
Stephanie , two Havana Clubs , please .
Yes , Mr Tolar .
How`d the tests turn out ?
We were worried for no reason .
Good .
I didn`t think we got on in the schoolyard .
Maybe I`ve grown up since then .
I`d love to believe that .
- It`s delicious .
- Isn`t it ?
It`s Iike cognac .
You know , I have a bad reputation .
- What do you do ?
- I run around .
Why do you do that ?
It`s because my wife understands me .
The fact is , I love my wife .
And she`s ...
WeIl , I guess she`s Iost interest in me .
I know I have .
And ...
I haven`t cared for anyone since .
I`d Iike to , though .
I miss it .
My , you Iay a Iot on a girI for a first date .
Is that what this is ?
This is unit ``B`` .
We`II be puIling over at 1 1 : 1 % for a 20- minute rest stop .
Mrs Sunderland , I need to speak to you about something that`s ...
WeIl , it`s quite embarrassing .
You`re not the only client I`ve caIled about this .
I`d Iike a steak , medium rare , three fried eggs over ,
French fries , and coffee , please .
WeIl , I`II see ya , darling .
Fuck !
What`s going on ?
We Iost your brother .
Were you foIlowing him ?
You trying to fuck with me ?
Where are you and those files ?
You want the files , wire the money .
- I want them now .
- I gotta go .
He knows exactly where his brother is .
Check the credit cards of every rig that got fueI outside that diner around 1 1 : 4 % , whenever we Iost Ray .
Couldn`t be more than a dozen .
He`II be on one of them .
And get me a map of Louisiana .
Get me a map of Louisiana !
Hasn`t even begun to melt .
The staff was chosen for its timing .
I would do that , but I could never do that .
The buttons are too smaIl .
It requires terrible desktermindy ... dex ...
Dexterity .
Amazing .
- What are you doing here ?
- What do you mean ?
I mean , exactly what did you come here for ?
I was invited .
You`re not being truthful .
- Why are you doing this ?
- Because I`m sick .
I want you to teII me the truth .
I came to punish Mitch for Ietting the firm run our Iives .
I came ... because Mitch slept with someone else here .
Is that what you want to hear ?
It`s better than the alternative .
What alternative ?
That you came here to see me .
Avery ?
Came in about three hours ago .
- Sure he`s aII right ?
- You want to caII 1 1 ?
Get the stuff , and get over here .
Keep caIling him .
Wake the sonofabitch up .
When you do , find me .
I want that girl .
Account number 614408- S.
Can you confirm that it`s 7% 0, 000 ?
Absolutely .
I`m fixing to get out of here now .
You got aII the information ?
Yeah , but , Mitch ,
I`ve been Iooking at this stuff , and there`s no numbers Iisted .
There`s no numbers ?
No amounts ?
I got paper from bank accounts from everywhere , but there`s no amounts .
I can`t play this poker game and bluff .
I got to know how much they have and where .
There`s a note on each one that says ... ``Info held by client and my Mac . `` Signed AT .
Is there any other information ?
Is there a password ?
Look on the paper , Tammy .
Wait .
On the side of one , in parentheses it says , ``R- e- f, `` then a colon , then ``Cordelia . ``

I knew he was a closet idealist .
He doesn`t know I`m here ... but I did do it for him .
That`s even better than getting even with him .
You got to get out of here .
What are you going to do ?
Abby , the girI was a setup .
On the beach , she was a setup .
They do things Iike that ... just in case the usuaI inducements don`t work .

Have a seat .
OK , Rudy , he`s headed east up the aIley .
Get him .
This way ...
There !
I knew they wouldn`t find her .
I need him here .
Get him back on that plane .
If we don`t get McDeere before he talks to the feds ...
- What direction was he running ?
- It`s McDeere .
- Where are you ?
- Never mind .
What happened ?
Look , I`II send you a car .
Just come on in .

He`s withholding evidence .
He`s got 3/ 4 of a miIlion doIlars of our money .
He`s a fugitive .
I want him .
Use the Memphis police if you have to .
It`s a red ten ton , registered to Farley`s Catfish Farm .
Get its routes and find that truck .
And issue APBs on Ray and MitcheII McDeere .
During the steamboat era which was peaked in the 1870s , these great floating palaces Iike the Robert E. Lee , whose modeI you see here , fiIled the Mississippi River .
The Robert E. Lee was designed for the Mississippi River ...
FoIlow me now to the deck where the cargo and passengers were carried .
The roIlers that powered the steam engine were here on the main deck ...
Hey , Mitch .
Mitch . .. the end of the steam era and advent of the railway .
The next gaIlery detailing ...
We have the working steam engine off the US Army snag boat , the Arkansas Il .
You Iight a fire underneath the boilers
The water is heated and turns it into steam .
The kids wanted me to bring them by .
Why , what`s the matter ?
OK .
Lamar , I just saw Mitch at Mud Island Museum .
He was zipping through Iike a tourist .
He didn`t see me .
Northwest Airlines flight 264 arriving from Chicago , gate B- 1 , main concourse .

Get the boys over there .

Abanks` Diving Lodge .

- OK .
Your brother`s on the plane , and Tammy`s Ioading the ship now .
It worked out .
Your Iawyer friend is dead .
He never was on the boat .
He canceIled the charter .
- How did ...
- He drowned ... in his bathtub after the Iady Ieft .
Didn`t Tammy teII you ?
What ... what Iady ?
How did you get ...
I don`t know .
Tammy`s friend slipped him a Mickey Finn .
It was somebody he knew .
What are you talking about ?
What Iady friend ?
Now , wait a minute .
Mitch is asking about Abby .
Isn`t that her name ?
Excuse me .
He`s in that door .
I`II go around the front .
Damn it .
Where`s the ...
You sick sonofabitch !
I can talk .
Isn`t that what I`m doing ?
If it`s something else , please advise me , Maury .
I Iike Iearning new things at % 00 an hour !
I swear , every fucking Iawyer ought to be kiIled .
You want to meet McDeere ?
For what ?
So you can charge me 1 , 000 an hour while I`m in Joliet for 30 years ?
This kid`s cut a deal , and I`II bet it`s a beaut .
- If I find this fucking kid ...
- Excuse me .
- Not now , Ruthie .
- It`s urgent , Mr Morolto .
Ruthie thinks it`s urgent , Joey .
It`s a Mr McDeere .
Mr MitcheII McDeere .
He`s waiting to see you .
I think Ruth is right .
I`m Mitch McDeere .
I`m your attorney ... one of them , anyway .
I assume you knew , but I thought I`d mention it ... in case .
Would you care to sit down ?
Not reaIly .
I want to try and ...
This is just ...
This is ...
This is very awkward .
I`m afraid my firm has behaved in an uneth ... unethicaI manner .
It seems that we , Bendini , Lambert & Locke ... the entire firm ... has been engaged in a ... weIl , a ... conspiracy .
We`ve been ... overbiIling our clients .
In some cases , massive overbiIling .
I assure you , I had no idea any of this was going on when I joined the firm .
I have to report this criminaI behaviour .
But I can`t use ...
I can`t use your invoices without your written authorisation .
- Our invoices ?
- Tony , please , Iisten .
Yes , sir .
Your biIls .
It`s important to proove that we`ve overbiIled you .
That`s it ?
Pretty much .
WeIl , most of our clients have already agreed ... weIl , pretty much aIl ... except for you , which is why I`m here .
And this is what you`ve been talking to the FBI about ?
You want to turn our biIls ...
What we charged you , I should say overcharged you . - .. over to the government .
- Yes , sir .
- Does that in any way ...
- No , sir .
It does not waive your rights to complete confidentiality in any other area of the attorney/ client relationship .
I`m your Iawyer , gentlemen .
Whether I Iike it or not , I can`t talk about you even when I`m no Ionger your Iawyer .
That would be breaking my word , my oath .
AII right , Mitch .
Then what was this stealing of the files aII about ?
The files haven`t been stolen .
They`re in exactly the same place they were .
I just felt it was important for me to be thoroughly familiar with the precise makeup and whereabouts of aII your activities ... so I prepared copies of everything .
That way you and I can communicate perfectly .
And , of course ... if we have to talk to a third party , then I know everything ... right down to the penny , pound , franc , and Deutschmark .
I know everything you know ... as I should as your attorney .
And what if the firm should desire at some point to terminate your employment ?
Whatever I know , wherever I go ,
I am bound by the attorney/ client privilege .
I am very much Iike ...
I would say I am exactly Iike a ship carrying a cargo that wiII never reach any port .
And as Iong as I`m alive , that ship wiII always be at sea , so to speak .
Yasser fucking Arafat , huh ?
Never a night in the same place .
In any case , I need your written authorisation to release your biIls , Iike every other client has given .
You have this authorisation with you ?
I do .
- Anything in there ?
- Nothing .
Fuck !
You got the account number ?
Mitch says the money`s there ... 7% 0, 000 .
I love your mouth .
That`s not my best feature .
What is ?
Where are you ?
What is this ?
You Iet the Moroltos off the hook !
- They`re my clients .
- The Mafia`s getting away .
- You`re behind the times .
- So ?
They padded their biIls !
You think if they don`t kiIl , they aren`t bad .
Who`s hard to find ... the kiIler or the Iawyer who hides their money .
You want the Mafia ?
Get their Iawyers .
Without the firm the Moroltos can`t Iaunder money .
You are so naive .
Other Bendini Lamberts wiII be Iaundering money tomorrow .
- How wiII you get them ?
- One at a time .
I`m a Iawyer , and I got mine .
You`re the cop , Tarrance .
You get the rest .
With what ?
OverbiIling , maiI fraud ?
That`s exciting !
It`s not sexy , but it gets them 10, 000 and five years in prison .
That`s ten and five for each act .
Have you reaIly Iooked at that ?
You`ve got every partner on overbiIling .
There`s 2% 0 acts of maiI fraud there .
That`s racketeering .
That`s minimum 1 , 2% 0 years in prison and 2 . % miIlion in fines .
That`s more than you had on Capone .
Twist this how you want .
You made a deaI to save your ass .
You got our 7% 0, 000 , and you`re stiII a hotshot Iawyer .
That money was always for somebody else .
Yeah , I`m a Iawyer with references from the firm .
You want that on your resume ?
You think I`II ever turn on my ignition again without sweating ?
Then I don`t understand you .
What`d you do it for ?
- You didn`t win a thing .
- I won my Iife back .
You don`t run me , and they don`t run me .
Wanna know something weird ?
I discovered the Iaw again .
You made me think about it .
I got through Iaw schooI without doing that .
It`s you at the dog track .
I could`ve gone public with it .
- Why didn`t you ?
- It`s against the Iaw .
OK .
How the heII did you come up with maiI fraud ?
It was on the bar exam .
They made me study Iike heII for it .
You`ve had a busy day .
So did you .
Why didn`t you teII me the truth about your plan ?
AII of it ... the Moroltos .
I knew you`d worry and that might make you stay ...
You needed to Ieave .
I Iike what you`ve done to the place .
- You were going to your folks .
- I was .
Some detour .
- Where are you going ?
- To Iook for you .
I guess I couldn`t Ieave you without trying to help you .
Wanna teII me what happened ?
Someday .
I think you should know that Avery was ... pretty decent .
He was decent ... and corrupt and ruined and so unhappy ...
Listen , Abby ...
- It could`ve happened to you .
- Did I Iose you ?
- You Iook tired .
- Did I ?
I`ve loved you aII my Iife .
Even before we met .
Part of it wasn`t even you .
It was just a promise of you .
But these Iast days ...
You kept your promise .
How could you Iose me ?
- You think it`II make it ?
- Make it where ?
- Boston .
- What`s in Boston ?
We are .
And the Wong Boys ... and my kids ... .. and a very smaIl , unknown Iaw firm ... .. with a Iot of potential .
Yeah .
