- [you] How about you ?
Do you remember your mother when y' all were living together ?
No , not really .
I used to try to remember her .
Anything about her .
Like her voice , the way she smelled , you know , anything .
I used to think real hard ... wanting memories .
And I just started making them up .
That she was putting on her eye shadow and talking to me in the mirror ... or I' d pretend that ... she' d make me these perfect grilled cheeses with the crusts cut off .
I had all kinds of made- up memories .
My favorite one was that she' d take me to see her shows ... and I would be sitting on the side with this nice man ... who' d give me all the Shirley Temples I wanted .
I made up so many memories ...
I actually started to believe I was really remembering her .
But she never came for me , so I just forgot .
You know ... stopped pretending .
Ho , ho , ho !
- Is that a real tree ?
- Lord , where did you get that ?
It fell off the back of a truck .
- Like hell it did .
- All right , maybe it was a Volvo .
We should put it right up front where everybody could see .
Sure .
Lawson , where' s the laundry ?
Shit .
" I remember the day I graduated from protégé to confidant .
" He never meant to let me in on his secrets .
" He thrived on his own mystery .
" But once the first one was discovered ...
" it wasn' t long before there were none left between us .
" I was on the back steps of the library ...
" when I spotted his uniform , a freshly laundered shirt ...
" the color of Easter , and that damn hat .
" He strode across campus with purpose .
" Everything about Tommy said ready . "
- I' m Tommy , just so you can follow .
- Sounds just like you .
" He almost skipped right passed me . " ' Nice hat , ' I said ...
" eliciting Tommy' s notorious smile .
" It was the same smile that he granted to each woman that caught his eye .
" The smile that served as an answer to all undesirable questions .
" Or the smile for one of his children ...
" whenever he found a tiny hand reaching for his . "
That' s nice ...
- but I think that might be a bad sentence .
- I think they all are .
That' s why they' re hanging from the goddamn Christmas tree .
No , but it' s just that , normally , it' s just not on ...
" Tommy took the stairs , two at a time , bellowing , ' Well , God damn ...
" if it isn' t the South' s next great native son . '
" I was only one of hundreds who came religiously twice a week ...
" to be dazzled by the Professor , each performance worthy of applause .
" Tommy , at the front of the hall , waving his arms wildly ...
" as if mastering an imaginary lasso . "
- I like " lariat " better .
I think you ...
- I like " lasso . "
Years ago , you trusted my opinion .
Years ago , you were easier to trust .
Thank y' all very much .
Have a Merry Christmas .
Nobody can do the Alabama shuffle as good as Bobby Long ... but this sweet thing , she can move .
- Why can' t you be this sweet all the time ?
- Sure , and what would that get me ?
Pure , unadulterated joy .
- You keep your lecherous eyes off our girl .
- What ?
She don' t like me .
She likes Lawson better than she likes me .
You like Lawson better than me , don' t you ?
You' re drunk .
You know what , I am .
I really am .
But it' s all right , because Lawson is gonna take us home .
Not tonight .
I got him all to myself .
You told them about the news , honey ?
We were just thinking that maybe after the holidays ... he could move in with me and get some more work done .
It' s just something that we kicked around .
Lawson is not in love with you .
Bobby , I don' t think that' s any of your damn business .
I' ve seen him with a woman that he can' t get enough of .
A woman that' s crawled into every molecule of his being ... that consumed his every thought ... and turned him into a creation of devotion and obsession .
I have the scars of that love on my face .
Have you told her about that ?
Have you told her about the difference between true love ... and a warm bed to pass the time away ?
Cool it .
Don' t go after her .
I never said I was going anywhere .
I only speak the truth .
The woman deserves to know the truth .
And you , you' re free to do as you please .
Am I , really ?
Finally free ?
I want to say something on this occasion ... where we' re celebrating our love and friendships with one another .
" Friend by enemy I call you out
" You there , with a bad coin in your socket
" You there , my friend with a winning air
" Who palmed the lie on me when you looked Brassily at my shyest secret
" With my whole heart under your hammer
" That though I loved him for his faults
" As much as for his good
" My friend were an enemy on stilts
" With his head in a cunning cloud "
Bravo , man .
Now , why don' t you come out and fucking say what you really mean ?
Does every word out of your mouth have to be in character ... or is that the idea :
Just to be anybody but who you really are ?
You want to tell me that you' re disappointed in me ?
' Cause maybe I' m disappointed in you .
You know , I never asked to write your damn book .
Your redemption and my penance , right ?
Haven' t I paid ?
Nine fucking years .
I am sorry , all right ?
I am so fucking sorry .
It' s Dylan Thomas .
That' s an easy one .
Good night , Bobby .
Shit .
You okay ?
Can I come in ?
You really did a number on yourself this time .
Lawson' s gonna leave me right by myself .
I always knew it .
I deserve it .
I' m gonna die alone .
He' s not gonna leave you .
- Yes , he is .
- No .
He' il always be there for you .
He cut up my story and hung it on the Christmas tree .
Honey , I peed myself .
All right , let' s get you into bed .
Come on .
Oh , God .
It' s so damn cold .
How is he ?
- I think he peed blood .
- God damn it .
I knew he wasn' t himself tonight .
He' s afraid of doctors .
It' s probably some bacterial thing .
It' s nothing .
- Are you gonna move out ?
- No .
Are you in love with her ?
No .
She' s really nice .
Yeah , she is .
Are you worried about him ?
What happened , Lawson ?
When I met Bobby , he seemed absolutely larger than life .
Did whatever the hell he wanted ... but still he had the beautiful wife and kids .
Students loved him .
Faculty hated him .
Women wanted him .
Christ , he had me so convinced of my own grand destiny ...
I may have fallen a little in love myself .
We hung out all the time .
There was a woman who I wanted to marry .
Her friend fell for Bobby pretty hard .
He started spending more time with us than he was at home .
One night , their youngest had a Little League game .
It was a double- header .
So I convinced him to have drinks with the girls first .
Said I' d go to the game with him later .
He kept on saying he had to leave .
Somehow one drink became two , and then three .
And then ... this idiot , the dean' s nephew ... came in and announced ... that he was sleeping with my girlfriend ... and everyone knew but me .
I went after him .
He took a swing .
Bobby stepped in ... and he cracked Bobby' s face wide open .
Bobby went crazy .
He beat up that kid pretty bad .
It' d just gotten so late .
I knew Ben would be waiting .
But when we got there , he was gone .
Everyone was .
He should never have been by himself .
He was just a little boy , and it was so dark .
There' s too many people ... in such a damn hurry on that road .
There' s no way a driver could have seen him .
I mean , he was so little .
And , God , he worshipped his dad .
Juliette told Bobby to leave and never come back .
She needed a better man .
That' s how she put it .
So you came here ?
Seemed like a good place to write .
It was far away ...
good universities .
Bobby could start over .
I thought I should be here with him .
I mean , if it wasn' t for me that night ... things might have ...
I don' t know what happened , really .
We read too many damn books .
There' s something about this city .
That' s all .
You should get some sleep .
I made you breakfast in mattress .
Thank you , ma' am .
Have we heard from the man yet ?
No .
Should we get him up first ?
Can you give me that shirt , please ?
Thank you .
Nice hat .
Get up , old man .
I hear we gotta take you to a doctor .
And get that off your pecker .
What do you care ?
You' re slicing it up , anyway .
It doesn' t mean I want my book getting the clap .
I had the urge to read something likable about myself .
Find anything ?
Not really .
I didn' t mean to mess things up between you and Georgianna .
I didn' t mean what I said .
Oh , Christ .
Last night was a blur .
I don' t know what was said .
And I don' t want to remember .
- Come on .
- Good , presents .
Yay !
Merry Christmas !
'
I' m so full .
- Me , too .
- Me , too .
I wish it would snow .
- Me , too .
- Me , too .
But I love the rain .
- Me , too .
- Me , too .
Come on , man .
You gotta piss sometime .
Christ , I can' t do it while you' re watching me .
I' ve seen you piss a thousand times .
Well , suddenly I am shy , okay ?
Piss right now .
Christ , it' s probably nothing , man .
I' ve lived long enough anyhow .
Lord , it' s cold .
It' s clear .
I pissed clear .
Like hell you did .
Don' t lie to me .
So it was a little pink .
I' m not going .
You got any short stories you haven' t destroyed by fire or scissor ?
My English final , I gotta write something ... and read it in front of the entire class , and there' s no exceptions .
- Fuck !
- So you' re doing okay in English .
I' m doing okay reading English .
I' m not a writer .
- What the hell are you wearing ?
- What do you care ?
It' s Lorraine' s .
You just let her stuff collect dust in there .
You' d rather freeze than wear your mama' s clothes .
This robe and the person who wore it ... is worth more than a hundred people who don' t appreciate them .
Is something wrong ?
- You gonna tell her ?
- Tell her what ?
We gotta take Bobby to the doctor .
He' s still pissing blood .
He' s been putting it off for weeks .
Okay .
I hope you' re not wearing them lady underwear .
I most certainly am .
They' re good luck .
Besides , they' re gonna take them off anyway ... and put one of them backless numbers on me .
Everybody' s seen my peter .
That' s right .
Everyone just wants to see your peter .
And my ass .
Let' s go .
What did I tell you ?
Goddamn string draped over my ass .
Where' s Bobby ?
I made him that andouille gumbo shit he loves .
They needed him for some more tests .
- Is he all right ?
- They think so .
They just gotta look at his toe and make sure .
Well , then , maybe you might wanna invite Georgianna over for dinner .
I think she' s working .
Is there an occasion I don' t know about ?
I have a date .
Really ?
That' s a first .
I figured it was about time I got a life .
Great to hear it .
- Is that a new dress ?
- Yeah .
Well , sort of .
I mean , Bobby' s right .
There' s no reason to let Lorraine' s clothes collect dust .
She was really tiny .
You should have seen me trying to zip it up .
Just make sure it stays zipped up .
I' m a big girl , Lawson .
I have been for quite some time now .
Hey , is that an SAT application ?
Yeah .
My guidance counselor gave it to me .
I meant to throw it out .
What ?
If she thinks your grades are good enough for college , you go to college .
- Well , college costs money .
- There' s financial aid .
I might have to go away .
You might .
- I have to go .
- Isn' t he picking you up ?
No .
I' m meeting him somewhere .
You can' t walk home from the streetcar alone .
- Call me at Ray and Ruthie' s and I' il ...
- No , I' il get a ride .
Besides , you should spend time alone with Georgianna .
You haven' t stayed over there since before Christmas , right ?
You said you wanted to see more of the New Orleans music scene .
I figure this is a good place to start .
- I know him .
- Really ?
Hey , sugar , what are you doing here ?
My friend Sean brought me .
Sean , this is Junior .
Great to meet you .
I' ve seen you play around , man .
You are great , man .
Really , really great .
How come I didn' t know you were a badass sax player ?
Well , I don' t play much anymore , you know .
I mean , I don' t have ...
Don' t got the lungs for it .
- How' s Bobby ?
- Better than you sound .
- You sitting in again , or what ?
- Tiny , there' s somebody I want you to meet .
This can' t be that sweet baby girl , Purslane .
- You don' t remember me , do you ?
- No , sorry .
When your mama used to play here ... she used to sit you right over there on that stool .
And you was so cute .
See , my job was to keep you full of Shirley Temples .
You remember that ?
With Junior .
You used to play with Lorraine back then .
You were in the band , weren' t you ?
Yeah , she and Junior was our best night here , when they wasn' t bickering .
Little Purslane .
Look , you come back and see old Tiny again , all right ?
And the Shirley Temples on the house .
See you later , man .
You were really in Lorraine' s band ?
Of course I was .
I mean , everybody was at that time .
That' s just how it was .
Lorraine and me ... we were close at one time .
I remember the last time she wore that dress .
It looks just as pretty on you .
I gotta go .
Glad you came , honey .
Why didn' t you tell me your mama was a singer ?
That' s so cool .
I don' t know .
It was a long time ago .
You want a drink ?
I' m ready .
Jesus .
Are you anxious to get home ?
Unless you and Purslane don' t want me around anymore .
You finally figured us out .
- What' s the verdict ?
- I got a kidney infection .
They gave me some medicine .
Said I got to dry out .
What about the toe ?
It' s just a fungus .
Got goop .
You' re a lucky man .
You' re gonna be all right .
Of course I am .
But what if I wasn' t ?
What do you mean ?
I saw you with Purslane on Christmas Eve .
- Are you sleeping with her , Lawson ?
- No .
How could you think that ?
Because she' s becoming more fetching every day .
Because she' s a young woman .
She' s got a crush , and we both know how nice that is .
- She' s a kid , Bobby .
- She' s 18 .
My wife was 18 when I met her .
It was love at first sight .
Nothing happened .
That night ... things had gotten a little out of hand ... and I think she was kind of frightened by it all .
She was feeling a bit lonely and cold .
Well , my guess is that she wasn' t the only one .
Just remember , she' s Lorraine' s daughter .
- You' re jealous .
- Absolutely .
Shit , I ain' t worth this much .
Fuck , no .
'
Spring , and we' re still here .
How about we grab a bottle of wine ... and go down to the river like we used to ?
What do you think of that ?
Remember that very generous girl who used to skinny- dip ?
- What was her name ?
- I don' t know .
She' s born- again now .
Think we' il still be living together in heaven ?
If we make it to heaven , then everybody will be there ... and I' il have my pick of goddamn debauchers :
Byron , de Sade , Hemingway .
I' il be more fun than all of them whiners put together .
Yes , I guess you would .
- I really think Pursey can get financial aid .
- Will you forget that ?
She' s gonna go off to some fancy school after we taught her everything she knows .
We' il still be sitting here getting older and uglier ... and any spring could be our last ...
God damn it , I wanna go to the river now .
Why are you such a dramatic old bastard ?
" I just want to breathe in every day .
" Happiness makes up in height what it lacks in length . "
- Robert Frost .
- Come on .
You know damn well she' il miss us if she leaves .
If she leaves , she' s gone .
Final chapter .
End of story .
I want to go to the river now .
But I need peace and quiet .
I got so much to do ... to pull off this graduation .
I gotta write a short story , or poem , or something .
I can' t think of anything .
- I' m gonna blow the whole thing .
- I know you .
- You' il be fine .
- I' il see you later .
Hey , babe .
I' ve been waiting for you all day .
Lee , what are you doing here ?
How did you find me ?
You smell nice .
Aren' t you gonna ask me in ?
I drove all night .
And I got you this .
This place really looks like you .
All those lady magazines ...
I don' t read those anymore .
I don' t have the time .
What are you doing now ?
You waitressing ?
No , I' m ...
It' s none of your business .
Man , you must be doing okay .
No rent ... and this place definitely kicks ass over the trailer .
- Lee , what do you want ?
- What do you mean ?
I just came up here to make sure that you' re safe ...
- once Lorraine' s fool friends get the boot .
- What are you talking about ?
Those guys that you had to share this place with .
How do you know who I live with ?
Some lawyer sent you a letter .
Which you , of course , opened .
Their year is almost up ... and I' ve been trying really hard to better myself .
- I' ve missed you so much ...
- This letter says as of July 1 ...
- I' m the sole owner of this house .
- Yeah , I know .
You didn' t know that ?
Jesus Christ , man !
- Those fucking scumbag losers lied ...
- They are not losers .
They' re my ...
- They' re your what ?
- You cannot call them losers .
You think that ...
I have a real life now .
I go to school ...
- A real life ?
- Yeah .
As opposed to the piece- of- shit life that we had ?
And I guess you got some real men in your real life , too .
Men who lie to girls so they can have a roof over their heads ?
- Fuck you !
- Or what ?
Are they getting something else for their trouble ?
They used you , Purslane .
- Just like they used Lorraine .
- Get out .
That' s just fine !
I came all the way up here to see you !
You' re in school now .
That' s some funny stuff .
I want you to remember something , Purslane .
A weed is just a weed ... no matter how pretty the flower .
That' s just fucking brilliant , Lee .
Get out !
What the hell is going on ?
She must be cleaning or something .
She locked the door .
Pursey , open up , honey .
Pursey , it' s us .
Pursey , honey , open up .
- You locked the door .
- God damn it , I told you this would happen .
No .
Oh , God .
How ?
Let' s go .
She needs some time .
Two goddamn days and no one' s seen her .
She asked for the weekend off .
The trail is exhausted .
Ray said she came in early this morning .
Used the phone .
- She snuck past us ?
- Probably on purpose .
You have not been very supportive in this ordeal .
You' re staying with me , aren' t you ?
You' re welcome to go elsewhere .
I can rectify this .
Tomorrow she goes to school .
I' il set the alarm .
Get up early .
Talk to her on the way .
Work this whole thing out .
We don' t have an alarm .
Sweetheart , we' ve been waiting for you .
What do you think ?
It' s all your favorite colors .
And guess who helped ?
We had Ray , and lke , and even Earl .
It' il probably add value to the selling price , so thanks .
Don' t know why you have to go so soon .
We' il still be friends .
It' s them I wanna get away from .
You know they didn' t mean to hurt you ...
Why don' t you start off in the kitchen ?
I' il finish this .
"
" '
"
" '
"
"
" '
" ' '
" "
Honey , where do you want me to put your glasses ?
What' s wrong ?
How could you talk about her all the time and never tell me this ?
Is this true ?
" Your singing touched my soul .
Bobby Long . "
I always suspected , but she never told me .
I loved her first .
And Bobby got here , and all hell broke loose .
Bobby was still married .
He never even knew how she felt .
She worked so hard to get clean .
And when she did , she came home for a big show at the Howlin ' Wolf .
This show ?
The date' s right .
She said your grandma would bring you up .
You never did show .
He never did , either .
Boy , she was devastated neither one of you was there .
" To my sweet Bobby .
" I am feeling better and coming home to sing you a brand- new song .
" Please come .
Someone I love will be there and I want to introduce you . "
This was you , darling .
You and Bobby .
I just ...
I can' t believe it .
Why do you keep drinking that shit ?
Don' t you know it' s gonna kill you ?
Didn' t you watch Lorraine ?
God , sometimes you make me so fucking sick .
You' re living in some fantasy world ... where life' s a book and no one takes responsibility for writing .
Every idiot knows that books are better than life .
That' s why they' re books !
Pursey , honey , you go right ahead and be wicked .
We deserve it .
But when you' re finished , why don' t we just all sit down and talk like a family ?
Like a family .
Would that be like that family you destroyed ?
Are we just gonna be like that family ?
' Cause the weird thing is that , according to Lorraine , I am your family .
Couldn' t you count to nine months ?
I never understood why she would want me to live with y' all ...
but you' re my father .
I just ...
Did you love her ?
- Did you love her ?
- Yes , very much .
But I just ...
I wish we never knew .
No .
Don' t go , Pursey .
Don' t walk away .
- It' s too late .
- No , it' s not too late .
You got me now , honey .
You' re not alone anymore .
Let me be here .
What can I do ?
Tell me .
What , honey ?
Remember when I told you I made up memories about her ?
Yes .
The really pathetic part was that I used to make up memories about myself .
Like parents got lots of stories about their kids .
You know , like , " Wasn' t it cute when Suzie couldn' t say supercalifucking ... "
Whatever .
I mean , people remember a lot of weird shit .
Like you probably got a ton of stories about your kids , right ?
Yes , I do .
Well , I kind of felt that maybe ...
I used to do some cute or funny stuff when I was little .
But the truth is nobody was really there watching , were they ?
Honey , I was there .
Sweetheart , I was there .
I saw .
It was never very long , but I was there .
- Will you tell me about her ?
- Yes .
- Every tiny thing about her ?
- Oh , yes .
And about me , too ?
' Cause I think I really need to know now .
Yes .
I don' t want to sell our house .
I love our house .
I just ...
I was so mad at you .
I' m so sorry .
I don' t remember how to do this .
I' il do it for you .
Shit , man .
Your foot' s blue .
I' ve been practicing wearing this shoe .
It' s just numb , is all .
I don' t want any reason for my daughter to be ashamed of her daddy .
- Now , how do I look ?
- Damn good .
- How do I look ?
- Well , pretty good .
Your hair' s sticking up .
There you go .
Good Lord , y' all look like regular taxpayers .
- Maybe I ain' t dressed appropriate .
- You look fine .
Your fly is down .
Come on , we' re gonna be late .
Are you ready to see our daughter graduate ?
Yes , I am , sir .
- It' s a day to count our blessings .
- Yes .
Quiet , everybody .
Quiet down .
I' d like to propose a toast ... to my very beautiful daughter , Purslane Hominy ... who is my very own golden girl .
Cecil mentioned earlier that today was a day we should count our blessings .
And as I look around , I see that there are many ... that I have not given credence to .
I am thankful for a God that I had thought had given up on me ... and the love of a child who , God willing ... will be in college this fall .
And not no Vinegar Bend Junior College , neither .
My baby' s smart .
Smarter than her old man .
That' s for goddamn sure .
Pursey , honey , you have taught this old fool a thing or two .
And in the glorious words of T. S. Eliot :
" We shall not cease exploration .
" And at the end of all our exploring ...
" will be to arrive where we started ...
" and know the place for the first time . "
And that' s what you' ve given your old man .
And he is forever grateful .
Now , come on up and give your old man an Alabama shuffle .
Play that slow one that I asked for .
