Do you know what I mean ?
But it suits me just fine .
To be honest , I rarely spend a night in my own bed anyway .
You see , here' s my theory :
For most women , if a guy' s a good provider and generally a nice chap , six- pack abs really aren' t a deal- breaker .
On the flip side , however , even though the PC boyfriend sat next to you with his arm slung around your shoulder will deny it ...
And he will deny it .
For us boys , it' s all about F. B. B.
Face .
Boobs .
Bum .
I' m just being honest .
It' s been said that clothes speak the international language .
And I have to admit , I' m a bit of a fashion whore .
Unfortunately , today I' ve got work , and I have to tone it down a little bit , but that' s all right .
Gucci .
End- of- summer sale .
Very understated .
And I can easily spice it up with ...
What ?
No , no .
I know what you are thinking .
If you ooze masculinity , like some of us do , you have no reason to fear pink .
Smashing .
Now , in the cologne department , most men overdo it .
Americans practically spray it on with a crop- duster .
My rule :
Nothing above the neck , though I do like a little splash on Big Ben .
You never know where the day may take you .
Almost forgot .
New word for the day .
" Ostentatious :
The attempt to attract attention to oneself . "
Who ?
Me ?
Oh , blimey .
I' m so rude .
I haven' t introduced myself .
- I' m ...
- Alfie ?
There you go .
Alfie .
Are you the little elf that left these mocha bonbons on my doorstep ?
No , no , no .
You must have a secret admirer , Mrs Schnitman .
You are such a doll , Alfie .
But I' m supposed to be on a diet .
Oh , on a diet ?
- A diet .
- You ?
- Yeah .
- Now , I don' t mean to be forward , Lu , but you should know by now that a full- figured girl like yourself
- is every guy' s secret fantasy .
- Stop it .
So she' s a tub of lard .
The ship' s already sailed , so why not make her feel good about herself , right ?
- Oh , Lu ?
- Yes , angel ?
I' m working the night spot , and my apartment is a horror show , so I' m sorry if I keep you up
- with the dust- busting at 2 a . m .
- Oh , don' t you worry .
- I' il give it a quick straighten .
- Oh , no , no , you don' t need to that .
Nonsense .
I like doing things for you , Alfie .
I' m a blessed man having you in my life .
Thank you .
Keys are in the usual spot .
Now , I must admit , I had a second motive .
I' d always been told that the most beautiful women in the world ... ... resided in Manhattan .
And when it comes to shagging birds , it' s all about one thing :
Location , location , location .
And with such a plethora ...
Calendar word meaning " abundance , " of gorgeousness and diversity , well , how could a man ever choose to settle down with just one ?
I myself subscribe more to the European philosophy of life .
My priorities leaning towards wine , women ...
Well , actually , that' s about it .
Wine and women .
Although , women and women is always a fun option .
So ... ... to live life to the fullest ,
I require only enough to cover my modest expenses .
I' ve no desire to be the richest stiff in the cemetery .
I think this might just be my favourite position .
I know it was President Kennedy' s .
He was such a great leader .
Of course , JFK used the old bad- back excuse , but if you ask me , he knew it gave you maximum pleasure with minimum exertion .
What is it about the back of a limo ?
Obligatory cuddling .
Thousand one , thousand two ...
Cripes .
Hey , I' ve gotta get cracking .
I' ve got a 10 : 00 pickup .
You better hurry up .
You don' t want to keep her waiting .
Quite the number , isn' t she ?
Yet , she tells me her old man hasn' t shagged her in six months .
Six months .
I mean , thank God there are gentlemen like me around to pick up the slack .
Just look at her .
Legs like a racehorse .
Perfect yoga bum .
I give her my highest grade :
A- minus .
Where did we tell the old man we were going tonight ?
- A movie .
- Treasure , please , no , no , no .
Stop messing about .
You' il ruin my presets .
- Sorry .
- What movie ?
I don' t know .
What' s the difference ?
The difference is , the more detail you give , the less interested he' il be .
It wouldn' t matter what I said .
It would never occur to Phil that another man
- would ever look twice at me .
- Dor , darling , you fishing for a compliment ?
No .
You should know by now they only come from me when least expected .
Now , come and have a mint so Phil doesn' t smell the Alfie on your breath .
I don' t care if he does .
There' s one thing that puts me off marriage :
It' s married women .
Dorie doesn' t know it yet , but you won' t be seeing much more of her .
I' ve got that all- too- familiar feeling .
Sooner or later , she' il be wanting a little bit more than I' m able to give .
Wouldn' t it be great if I was going home with you tonight instead of Phil the Pill ?
So next Tuesday , same time , same place ?
I' m sorry , love , it' s Fashion Week .
I' m booked double shifts .
- I' il call you the instant things let up .
- Okay .
In the meantime , I left you a little souvenir to remember me by .
Oh , Dor ?
Your derri√®re looks really rather ravishing from this vantage point .
See ?
A compliment when least expected .
What can I say ?
Happy as a pup with two tails .
And I think I' ve done old Phil a bit of a favour too .
Of course , he' d be the last to see it .
Never expect any thanks in this life .
You know what I mean ?
So Tuesday ... ... 10 : 03 p . m .
Do I drag myself home to a cold flat , empty fridge , or nip across town for a hot bath , warm body , breakfast in bed ?
Decisions , decisions ...
Let me guess .
Unexpected last- minute fare .
Yeah .
She had me going up and down for hours .
That supposed to be funny ?
Because it is so very ...
Not .
Hey !
I' m not kidding , Alfie !
I' m not kidding .
I hate you sometimes .
You have a very ostentatious way of showing it .
Yeah , I sure do .
No , darling .
Can we hit pause ?
I just need a second to unwind .
Oh , I nicked half a bottle of Stoli from the limo .
How do you want yours , on the rocks ?
I just want my usual , Alfie .
Straight up .
No , I' m so totally knackered .
I' il make it up to you in the morning .
Cross my heart .
But tonight , all I' m good for is a bite to eat , hot bath and a nice long sleep .
You know , this isn' t a Holiday Inn , Alfie .
What' s that again ?
Where were you tonight ?
Really ?
You' ve got to open a restaurant .
That' s seriously delicious .
Thanks , Alfie .
It' s just chilli .
Hey .
A little eye contact , please .
We have something here , or am I just a glorified booty call ?
Hey .
Hey .
Here' s what she' s really saying :
She wants me to commit .
Translation :
Become " domestified . "
Now , it doesn' t do to become dependent on anybody in this life .
Change your nature , you' re a dead man .
Chilli , please .
Don' t get me wrong .
She' s adorable .
Cute ?
Absolutely .
But is it ever enough ?
I told you how we men are .
We want showstoppers .
And the problem is , Julie hasn' t got enough of the superficial things that really matter .
- I don' t deserve you .
- Yeah , that' s probably true .
Too bad I love you .
Thanks , babe .
- Alfie , Alfie ...
- What ?
You' re giving me the " Thanks , babe . "
You' re giving me the " Thanks , baby . "
- Calm down .
- Don' t tell me to calm down !
- I know how you feel !
- Wait a minute .
- You' re gonna wake up ...
- Max .
Hey , little man .
Did we wake you up ?
Yes .
Now , lads , learn from my mistake .
Never get involved with a single mum .
See , they come with accessories , some of which can be ... ... unfortunately , irresistible .
Sights like that make you realize we all have an expiration date .
And women do have a shorter shelf life than men , don' t they ?
I think that' s what Julie was banging on about yesterday .
Elegant Limousine and Chauffeur .
This is where I make my reasonably honest living .
Standards of elegance has taken quite a pounding , wouldn' t you say ?
I know .
Believe me , it' s merely a stepping stone .
Currently parked on one of those stepping stones is my best mate and future business partner , Marlon .
Black .
Like Lonette' s skin ... ... which I will never again touch .
I' m afraid you' re not meeting my man on top form .
See , Marlon' s got a problem .
Three a . m .
Begging , at her front door .
- Level of inebriation ?
- Vomiting .
Right .
So let me get this straight .
You were at her front door , 3 a . m .
In the morning , begging and vomiting ?
And what , she wasn' t charmed by that ?
Alfie ?
Why is there no Stoli in car number two ?
I' ve no idea .
I gotta watch this guy like a hawk .
That little chap' s name is Wing .
My boss and owner of this tragic enterprise .
- Wipe that car good .
- Owner , that is , till me and Marlon swing a loan and buy it out from underneath his scrawny ...
Hello .
You miss bird shit .
Wing .
He' s barking mad .
Check out the way he talks to the little woman .
She' s given him her best years , cooked his chop suey , helped with the business , and I bet at one time he couldn' t wait to rip off her kimono .
And now look at him .
And I' m supposed to respect the institution of marriage ?
That' s a great figure , man .
We swing that loan , cash your IRA , I hock my Vespa ...
We' re gonna take Wing by surprise with an offer like this .
I could' ve predicted this .
See , Marlon and Lonette have reached that critical 18- month " Where are we going , what are we doing , what' s happening here ? " crisis point that rears its ugly head in every relationship .
Lonette wanted ring , home , baby .
Marlon wanted another 18 months to make sure nothing better was coming his way .
I fucked up egregiously .
I see you' re making the most of that birthday calendar .
By the time he realized he' d made a mistake and he wanted her back ... ... it was too late .
- Hey , stranger .
Hey .
Carol .
- Carol .
Hi , Carol .
- Hi .
You look wonderful .
So , Carol , well , it' s nice to see you again .
You be well .
What' s up with that ?
Put it this way , the show closed after one performance only .
- Do I even wanna know why ?
- No .
Come on , it would be less than discreet to tell you why .
Hair on the arms .
Seriously .
Long , thick ...
What are you talking about ?
You don' t have hair on your arms ?
- You' re looking very lovely tonight .
- Thank you .
Dude , the iron door has slammed shut , man .
Classic , isn' t it ?
Now that he can' t have her , he thinks he can' t live without her .
Some people are funny .
Anybody in the mood for a little Alfie , straight up ?
Oh , this isn' t a good time , Alfie .
Got a lot on my mind .
Oh , God .
Yeah , I really hate when that happens .
Open up , baby .
You look seriously beautiful .
- Not tonight , Alfred .
- What' s the matter ?
Tell me .
I don' t ...
I' m just ...
Well , I guess I' m ...
I' m just ...
I' m just seeing red .
I mean , the poor guy , he' s dying .
Come on , haven' t you ... ?
You' ve tortured him long enough .
Alfie , he should' ve thought about all that before he was screwing around with that ex- girlfriend of his .
Those fake- ass , $5 titties .
- Those are fake ?
- Hello ?
Wow , I' m devastated .
They' ve got , like ...
Alfie , you' re supposed to be consoling my devastation , remember ?
I am .
Look , he came back , didn' t he ?
Begging , crawling on his knees , vomiting ...
I don' t care .
I' m sorry , I' m not that easy .
I don' t forgive and I definitely do not forget .
I better go .
It' s really coming down out there .
Yeah .
And I' m wearing suede .
You' re telling the truth .
That' s brilliant .
Okay .
I got one .
I never swam in the Pacific Ocean .
- Me neither .
- Oh , shit .
Okay .
Okay .
I' ve never seen a James Bond movie .
You' re joking .
Not even a Sean Connery ?
You serious ?
Wow , I don' t know if that' s magic or tragic .
Okay .
Five ball .
My go .
- I' ve never made my own bed .
- Oh , bullshit .
No , I repeat , I' ve never made my own bed .
Well , what kind of mama you got ?
That' s a good question .
Let' s see .
All right .
- I got something for you .
- All right .
I' ve never had sex ...
I' ve never had sex with two people in one night .
Six- five , your favour .
Gotcha .
So , Alfie , what' s the most you' ve had in one night ?
We' ve stopped playing the game , haven' t we ?
Am I wrong , or is there a little innocent flirting going on here ?
See , if I had that kind of talent ...
- Go on , finish your sentence .
- If I had that kind of talent , and I looked like you ...
... I would be strutting my stuff - Oh , yeah ?
On a stage .
Alfie .
Alfie .
- Alfie !
- Shall I pretend I can' t hear him ?
Dude .
- Hey !
- Too late .
Too late .
- Dude , would you slow down ?
- Hey , Marly , what' s up ?
" Marly " ?
Hey , listen , I gotta talk to you .
You ain' t going nowhere till you tell me what went down last night .
- Down last night ?
- Dude , don' t mess with me .
What happened with Lonette ?
Have you ever heard the word " knock " ?
- What went down ?
- What ?
Nothing happened .
- We had a few shots .
- Missus give me silent treatment .
Little she know , not hearing constant " blah , blah , blah " is gift from heaven .
You keep it up .
Keep it up , mate , it' il work .
Alfie , what happened ?
Oh , fuck a duck , man .
Look , I ...
- I drank a lot last night .
- Drunk .
Well , I ...
I really ...
I don' t remember .
- Dude , you did something to her .
- No .
Oh , yeah , you did .
Because she shows up at my house , at 4 in the morning , saying that she wanted me back .
She even said that if I needed more time , that she understood completely .
How fucking crazy .
Chalk one up for the blokes .
Thanks to me , Marlon won the game .
Which means he' s off scot- free , and so am I.
This is a bloody miracle .
That' s fantastic .
Fantastic .
- Come on , what did you say to her ?
- Look , look .
- It' s all good .
- Come on , what did you say ?
I asked her to marry me .
You know you' re my best man , right ?
New word for the day ?
" Resilience :
The ability to readily recover after disappointment or loss . "
Capacity to spring back .
Hello , Uta .
Now , as a heat- seeking bachelor ,
I have to live by some very simple rules .
Alfie Elkins ' credo or philosophy , which is probably best summed up by the only advice my father ever gave me .
He said , " Son , whenever you meet a beautiful woman ... ... just remember , somewhere there' s a bloke who' s sick of shagging her . "
- Can I help you , man ?
- G and T , please .
Explain to me what everyone sees in that Eurotrash ?
I think it' s incredibly unfair that it' s acceptable for men to be sexually experimental , then with a woman , if she wants to try something ...
A kiss or a threesome .
You know , that they' d be judged .
I wouldn' t judge them .
And I think if you two were to kiss , I would ...
I would just ...
I would just see it as a thing of beauty .
Sorry .
I' m sorry .
You carry on without me .
Oh , my loves , I ...
I don' t know what happened .
This is so unlike me .
Yeah , you ...
You two just ...
... the unthinkable .
Now I really don' t get what everyone sees in you .
It just keeps on happening and happening .
Or more accurately , not happening and not happening .
This never happens , Uta .
Honestly , never .
Honestly .
Not the word around town ... ... peewee .
Mr Elkins ?
Miranda Kulp .
Miranda .
The penis doctor is a he with a little bit of she thrown in .
So I understand you' re experiencing some erectile dysfunction .
I am experiencing a little ...
A little ...
A little bit of ...
What you just said .
Not to worry .
That' s my area of expertise .
So have you been under any unusual emotional stress lately , Mr Elkins ?
Stress ?
Emotional ?
Me ?
No , never .
Well , unless you count that recent chat I had with Julie .
I can' t see you anymore , Alfie .
- Why ?
You angry ?
- No , I' m really not angry .
Just , you know , we want different things .
And I can' t have you traipsing in and out of Max' s life .
You' ve changed your hair , haven' t you ?
You have , haven' t you ?
No , you have .
You' ve changed your hairdo .
You cut it ?
It looks gorgeous .
- Thanks .
- How come ... ?
How come you never had it like that when we were together ?
I really gotta go .
Well , I guess ... ... you need these back .
Thank you .
Alfie ?
You gonna be okay ?
Yeah .
No worries .
I' m always okay .
Alrighty , let' s take a gander at that penis of yours .
I see .
Well .
- It seems we have lift- off .
- It seems we do .
What a relief .
Well , I mean , if he can give me a stiffy , I should have no problem keeping it up for the target demographic , shouldn' t I ?
Well , there doesn' t appear to be anything physiologically wrong , so , in short , we can be fairly certain your problem
- was simply stress- related .
- Translation :
Julie- related .
Like I always say , if they don' t get you one way , they' il get you another .
However ,
- I did feel something a little kooky .
- Kooky ?
There is nothing to get upset about , Mr Elkins .
I thought I felt a lump ... ... on your penis .
But with any luck , it will be nothing .
The words " lump " and " penis " in the same sentence .
There' s something you don' t hear every day .
A penis biopsy .
I get my test results in three days ...
Well , five .
Five counting the weekend .
Oh , Lord .
Oh , Lord .
How am I gonna stop myself going completely bonkers ?
I' il be fine .
I' il be fine .
I' m a young man .
Shift focus , Alfie .
Shift ...
Let' s go , kids .
Let' s go .
Move along , children .
Look straight ahead .
Come on .
Do not look at the man .
Look straight ahead .
In the meantime , perhaps I' m safer hobbling on home .
Alfie , dear , what' s wrong ?
You look like death warmed over .
No , I' ve just ...
I' ve got a bit of a football injury , that' s all ,
Mrs Schnitman ...
Hello , Mrs Liberman .
You two look lovely .
Where you going ?
- Shopping .
You need anything ?
- I' m fine .
Hello .
Can I talk to you for a minute ?
Ladies , this is my friend Lonette .
She' s lovely .
Good for you , dating an African- American .
Yeah .
Hey .
Hey , girl .
I missed you .
Don' t mind us .
We' re not here .
You kids keep talking .
- Very nice to meet you .
- See you , Mrs Liberman .
Shop till you drop , girls .
So how have you been ?
I' m pregnant .
Not to mention your host for this evening .
Didn' t take long .
Bloody hell , you' re freezing .
How do you feel ?
Empty .
That night in the bar , I thought I was getting something for nothing .
Doesn' t seem to have worked out that way , does it ?
Possibly .
- Next week .
- Excuse me .
Did I just ... ?
Did you just look at me ?
Did I just notice you turn away ?
Look , if you know the results to my tests , and they' re telling you ...
- Mr Elkins .
- Please .
Please .
Mr Elkins , for the millionth time , sit down .
Mr Belson , I have a cancellation on Tuesday at 11 : 30 .
I' m gonna be fine .
- I just feel it .
- Thank you .
Goodbye .
I' il just be a minute .
Or ten .
- It' s all right .
Take your time .
- I don' t have a choice .
I used to pee .
Now I trickle .
- I' m Joe .
What' s your name ?
- Alfie .
So how you doing , Alfie ?
- Hanging in .
You ?
- Shitty .
Yeah , me too .
Me too .
- I like the bolo tie .
- Oh , thanks .
I have a collection .
You know , when you' re old , you learn to be patient .
Yeah .
Used to be I never had time for nothing .
Go , go , go .
- I know that feeling .
- Yeah .
My wife was always hawking me to take a little vacation .
Hawaii .
Reno .
I always said , " Next year , Evie , next year .
I got too much on my platter . "
I always thought I' d have more time .
Then one Sunday night , she takes the pot roast out of the oven .
Yells , " Soup' s on , " and slumps to the kitchen floor .
Just like that .
Dead as disco .
Jesus , I' m sorry .
I tried picking up the pieces .
Even went to Waikiki alone on the 8- day cruise package she was always yakking about .
Couldn' t get Evie out of my mind .
There' s two things I learned in life , kid :
You find someone to love , and live every day as though it were your last .
She' s all yours , Alfie .
Enjoy .
You all right , son ?
Yeah .
I hope so .
Look , if you ever get bored or feel like schmoozing ... ... give me a holler .
- You' il never call .
- Maybe I will .
All right , good .
We' il go to a bar together , hit on some chicks .
Damn right .
Thanks , Joe .
Hey .
I' m sorry about Evie .
We ... ... weren' t all that fond of each other ... ... but we were very close .
- If you know what I mean .
- I think I do .
I' ve been thinking a lot lately about God and death .
And how , if what they taught me in Bible class is true ,
I' m really in for it .
But I won' t be partying with Lucifer any time soon , because my test results were negative .
I' m gonna live !
I' m gonna live !
I ruined my Prada lace- ups and I don' t care .
Don' t think I' ve forgotten my oath to completely change my life , because I haven' t .
Carrot- apple with a dash of wheat grass .
Yep .
Health is now priority number one .
Business plan moves onto the fast track .
- If you say so ...
- Tonight' s preview at St. Ambrose ...
No , I definitely don' t want to talk .
Okay , hold on , what else have I got ?
Okay , yeah .
All right , if we must , we must , but ...
New slate .
New beginning .
- What' s your name , driver ?
- Alfie , sir .
Wait here , Alfie .
Do you know how long you' re gonna be , roughly ?
- You got someplace to go ?
- No , I was just gonna nip off
- and get a cup of tea .
- Look , why don' t you just stay put .
Yea or nay ?
A definite yea , I think .
Really .
Stunning .
Wouldn' t you say so , sir ?
I' m sorry , didn' t I ask you to wait by the car ?
I reckoned I should help the lady with her packages .
Definite yea ?
I think .
With one minor ...
- May I ?
- You may .
Adjustment .
Bullfighter .
Another lifetime .
Don' t ask .
Fifty , if she' s a day .
But don' t they say 50 is the new 40 , and is she not living proof ?
I mean , have a look .
Beautifully preserved .
And cleavage like the Holland Tunnel .
- Better ?
- Much .
You are so right to trust Chanel .
A pair of hot- pink stilettos , and you' re good to go .
- Well , aren' t you Mr Full- Service ?
- We try .
- He' s getting a little pissy , isn' t he ?
- Oh , it' s fine .
It' s good for him .
- Is your husband a lot older than you ?
- He' s not my husband .
He' s wearing a wedding ring .
Well , I never said he wasn' t somebody else' s husband .
- Grab the stuff from the trunk ?
- You got it .
Cheers .
Ma' am , if you require my services in the future .
Happy Christmas , sir .
Ma' am .
You noticed the little flirt going on between us , huh ?
Makes me think , if a woman like that , of that calibre should take notice of a bloke like me , then , perhaps ...
Perhaps I' m selling myself a bit short .
Catastrophic .
Doomed .
Desolate .
Cataclysmic .
Bought him a word- of- the- day calendar for Christmas .
Big mistake .
Holiday season , busiest time of the year .
I try to run a business .
- What' s the problem , Mr Wing ?
- Your soul brother .
He quit .
That' s why I' m of the belief couples should never split up between Thanksgiving and January 2nd .
Always have a relationship to see you through the holidays .
Always .
The downside , of course , being gifts .
Personally , I' ve always suspected that everyone else is having a far merrier Christmas than I am .
Not that I' ve ever actually had a Christmas .
That' s a whole other Dickens story .
Taxi .
Taxi .
Excuse me .
I' m sorry , mate , it' s against the law for me to carry any more than ...
All right , hop in .
Thanks for saving us .
I was freezing my little tush off .
No worries .
You know , it' s pretty full back there .
- Why don' t you ...
- Good idea .
Why don' t I ?
Hey , watch the champagne .
All in .
- They don' t get out much .
- You wanna watch out , you guys .
You' il end up with a lump of coal in your stocking .
You' re English .
I love English .
- What' s your name ?
- Alfie .
You wanna abuse a little substance , Alfie ?
No , thanks .
I' m trying to quit .
All right .
One hit .
There' s an expression the Yanks use , " Go with the flow . "
So , yeah , I got a dose of the holiday blues .
But when a girl of this mind- blowing calibre invites you to a party , it' s time to get going and start flowing .
Maybe it' s the late hour .
Maybe it' s the heavily spiked eggnog .
I' m renovating my apartment on the Upper West Side .
But , say , you could ... ... crash at my sublet , if you want .
