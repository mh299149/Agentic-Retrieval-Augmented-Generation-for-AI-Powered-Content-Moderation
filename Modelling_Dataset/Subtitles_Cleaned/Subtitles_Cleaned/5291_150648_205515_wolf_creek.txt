Just tell me .
I' m listening .
Alright , well I heard about this guy who driving on the highway out there .
And , he see' s this light ahead of him .
Around 500 metres .
And , first he thinks it' s a truck or a semi- trailer or something coz the light' s really bright , like glowing orange and shit .
Yeah .
But as he gets closer he realizes the lights about 10 metres off the ground , it' s hanging in mid air .
So he' s scared .
He' s freaking out .
And then he hears this CRACK .
Like an explosion .
That was supposed to scare us .
I know , it' s not scary .
Alright , but he did .
He heard this crack .
Like an explosion , of a jet .
And it just took off into the sky .
Straight up like a rocket .
And then as soon as it was gone , his car just stopped in the middle of the road .
And it was totally silent , and he was just sitting there .
Staring up at the stars .
In the middle of nowhere .
Hey !
For no reason , just stopped .
Is that a true story ?
Absolutely !
He' s got something ..
You' ve got something dripping off the side of your lip there .
Oh , it' s all right .
It was just bullshit .
Nah bullshit you mate !
What' s all this shit ?
Oh it' s the tent .
Yeah for the tent .
Here I' il do that .
Start on the tent .
No , you do the tent .
I don' t know what you two would do without me .

Don' t go dicking her around , because she' s totally brilliant .
If you hurt her I' m gonna have to kill you .
So my advice is we all have an awesome time together .
You sort out what is going on between you and this girlfriend you' ve allegedly got .
By the time we get to Cairns we' il find some freakishly hot man for me .
And we' il all go crazy together , alright ?
Alright .
Mmm , she' s only a little one isn' t she .
I bet we could break that in half real quickly hey ?

I think it' s the start of the wet season , so ..
Thats beautiful over there isn' t it .
That light coming up through the mountains is gorgeous .
I hope it doesn' t rain .
What ?
I said I hope it doesn' t rain .
Man it' s gonna be cold tonight , and I mean cold .
Great .
Hey I think that' s the start of it .
Says in there you' ve got to climb over the top .
Umm , yep .
Aww ..
What was that ?
Rock .
There' s just nothing out here .
Yeah , it' s great .
Here we go .
Wolf Creek Crater !
The crater , we' re here !
Walking trail !
Walking trail !
Allow three hours .
Three hours ?
So is that three hours to get all the way into the middle or just to get up to the top ?
I' d imagine to the top .
No camping , hiking is allowed .
Put your rubbish in a bin .
No fires .
Ok .
Ok , let' s go .
Madame .
Thankyou .
Wolf Creek awaits you .
Oh wow .
Wolf Creek !
Wow ..
What is with this weather ?
Maybe we should take an umbrella .
Yeah .
Yeah definitely .
Alright , so what do you want to take ?
Definitely this !
All of it .
All that what' s in the esky .
All the food .
And who' s carrying all this ?
You are .
Just all of it .
Alright , three hours .
Let' s do it !
Let' s go .
Oh , wait !
Oh there' s poo everywhere , yay !
We' re on the poo planet .
What are you doing ?
It' s not even raining that bad .
Yeah it is .
It' s freezing and I' ve got no jumper .
Where did the meteorite go ?
It' s in the middle .
It just went into the ground ?
Yep .
Look how good it looks .
Cooooeee !
Come on !
You alright ?
Wow .
That' s impressive .
Yeah you' re looking at one of the biggest meteorite craters on the planet .
They reckon that the explosion from the impact would have been like 200 nuclear bombs going off at the same time .
Some guys discovered it scouting for an ore company in 1947 .
Imagine being the first person to see it .
Hey come on , let' s go .
You right ?
This is great Ben .
Yeah , just fantastic .
Thank you .
Such a sweetheart arent you ?
Loving it .
Yeah .. it' s great .
Sorry , I didn' t know .
It' il clear , give it a couple of hours .
Thankyou .
Back soon .
Where you going ?
I wonder why the meteor hit here .
In this place .
Nowhere else .
Maybe it was .. drawn to something in the earth .
Like when lightning strikes .
Hmm .
Yeah ?
Hmm .
Hi !
Hey !
That' s awesome .
I was wondering what that would be like .
Chris , what' s the time ?
Err , don' t know , watch has stopped .
Looks like Niagara Falls .

So about an hour till dark .
Make it back to Halls Creek easy
Christie' s watch stopped too .
Bullshit .. really ?

Batteries or something ?
You got the keys ?
Make sure you warm her up first .
It' s weird weather hey ?
Yeah I reckon .
God .

Did we leave the lights on ?
No .
No .
Is it ..
Is it in gear ?
Nah , Try ..
Try again .
Ahh .. fuck .
Ok ..
Shit ..
Alright , pop .. pop the hood .
It' s probably just the battery terminals .
Do you know what you' re looking for ?
You gonna tell Liz ?
I' ve got a feeling she already knows .
I' il go see what I can do .
You didn' t leave the lights on did you ?
No .
No .
Looks like we might be spending the night .
This is fucked .
Bitch .
Do you think it means anything ?
I mean .. the watches , and the car not working .
What do you mean ?
Well .. you know the stories I was telling you last night about the UFO' s and stuff . and .. when they were around .. well .. things stopped working .
Could be the same kind of thing .

Well he' s not going to fix it for free is he ?
I mean , what if he wants a couple of hundred pounds or something ?
A thousand ?

Ok , ok , well first we gotta find out if he wants any money or not .
I don' t have a lot of cash on me .
Me neither .
Neither have I.
Why don' t we get him to tow us back into town and we' il get someone there to fix it ?
Yeah .

Alrighty .
Well off you go .

Well it shouldn' t be too far .
That' s what you said an hour ago .
Well ok , lets just get him to drop us off here then .
Alright ?
It' s cool .
He said it was gonna be a bit of a drive didn' t he .
It' s cool .
Must be some sort of mining operation .
Mmm , looks like a ghost town .
We' re here .
Thank god .
Wherever here is .
Have plenty of water there if you want it .
Oh thank you .
It' s one thing we don' t have plenty of .
Thank you .
Cheers .
Nothing like rain water from the top end .
Hey Mick , this place is amazing .
Can' t believe they just walked out and left all this stuff here .
Plenty of places like this all over the outback .
Thousands of them .
Places people have forgotten about .
Sposed to be a whole town out there somewhere .
Got lost in a 6 month dust storm back in the 40' s .
People just walked away .
I heard of blokes getting lost in their own farms .
You know , just never found their way out .
On their own property ?
It' s amazing .
There' s one up here that crosses three states right .
Takes 6 days to drive across .
No .
I ..
I used to work out there once .
What did you do there ?
Head shooter .
You know , clearing vermin .
Roo' s , horses , pigs , buffalo .
You name it .
Don' t work there no more .
Yeah yeah , they use poisons , you know , instead of shooters .
Used to ..
Used to fly in with the helicopters .
You fly in low over a herd of water buffalo .
Sometimes take out 50 head in an afternoon .
I wore out 5 bolts on a . 303 one year !
Pigs , now pigs were different .
You have to get in close .
Get the dogs onto them .
Then you go in with a knife .
You had to get in under them , you know , while the pig is fighting off the dogs .
And you had to be quick or you' d lose your guts on it' s tusk !
It' s sharp !
I seen a big boar pig , right , take a pit bulls head clean off one time .
His little legs still pumping away .
Fair dinkum !
Fair dinkum ?
That' s what I said .
Fair dinkum .
Wow ..
Poor little fella .
So umm , where do you live ?
Oh I get around you know .
Never know where I might pop up !
Man you must love the freedom .
What ?
The freedom .
You know , you must love it .
Well you know , hanging out in nature and shit .
Right ..
You get to like , you know , cruise around the bush .
Saying cool stuff like ..
That' s not a knife , this is a knife !
What do you actually do .. now ?
I could tell you , but then I' d have to kill you .
So you don' t really shoot kangaroos do you ?
Nah look I' m doing people a service taking out a few roos .
They' re everywhere out here now .

Well did you see they way he was looking at you ?
He' s just trying to impress us with his great big white hunter thing there .
Yeah but he' s doing us a favour and he probably doesn' t appreciate us cracking jokes at his expense .
Seriously .
Lets just get the car fixed .
Yeah thats what we' re doing .
Don' t freak out .
