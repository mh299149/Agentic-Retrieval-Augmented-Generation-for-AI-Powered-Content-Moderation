They' re all dead !
Oh , God , they' re all dead !
Massacred !
The Alamo has fallen !
They' re dead , all of them !
They' re all dead at the Alamo !
( man ) Did you hear what he said ?
( men shouting )
The Alamo !
( sobs )
( softly ) Take the oath for militia duty , and you will receive 640 acres ... 640 acres of your own ... of your own choosing .
640 acres of your own choosing .
That' s better .
( ^ " String Quartet No . 5 " by Haydn )
Smooth .
If it doesn' t burn going down , how can you be sure it' s bad for you ?
I' il be interested to see you gentlemen when you arrive in Texas and have your first taste of mescal .
Is it true that men and women imbathe together out in the open ?
Cleanliness is next to godliness .
Yes , well ... excuse us .
Invest now , gentlemen , or lament later .
I' m a screamer .
I got the roughest racehorse , the prettiest sister , the surest rifle and the ugliest dog in the district .
My old man could lick anybody in Tennessee , and I could lick my old man .
I can outgrin a panther and ride on a lightnin ' bolt , tote a steamboat on my back and whip my weight in wildcats .
Whip my weight in wildcats .
Whip my weight in wildcats .
Whip ...
- What is it ?
- He' s here .
- Who' s here ?
- He is here !
( man ) Five minutes !
I' il tell you , these old bones could sure use a respite .
' Course , the good citizens of Tennessee may grant me that wish come next election .
- No !
- ( laughter )
- Excuse me one moment .
- Yes .
Yes , of course .
Sam Houston .
Makin ' friends wherever you go .
- To Tennessee .
- Oh , to hell with Tennessee .
To Texas .
( man ) It' s sad , isn' t it ?
A year ago , we' d be looking at two men with their caps set for the White House .
Now ...
What you peddlin ' , Sam ?
Somethin ' a certain Congressman might need before long .
Are you sellin ' rockin ' chairs ?
I' m sellin ' Texas .
Andwhatwould IwantwithNorteMexico ?
David , you remember what Tennessee was ?
You come to Texas .
Timber , water , game , cattle , more land than you can possibly imagine .
You take the oath for militia duty , you will receive 640 acres of your own choosing .
- My own choosing ?
- Mm- hmm .
Sam !
You figure this new republic' s gonna need a president ?
( music ends )
( man clears throat )
Before we begin tonight' s performance ,
I should like to acknowledge the presence of the man whose life inspired our humble play .
Good evening , Mr. Crockett .
Good evening , Mr. Crockett .
( laughter . applause )
( Scotsman ) You want to call me an opportunist ?
Hell , yes , call me an opportunist .
But taking the Alamo changed everything .
- We' re in control now .
- ( men ) Yes !
We swore allegiance to Mexico under the Federalist Constitution of 1824 .
Santa Anna tore that document up personally , did he not ?
Named himself supreme dictator ?
Well , I , for one , ain' t swearin ' allegiance to no son- of- a- bitch dictator .
( several ) Yeah !
( man ) Neither am l .
( Mexican accent ) Time to go , General .
They are talking crazy .
Drunk back sober .
It' s a miracle of the first order .
Seguin , why' d they put me in charge of the army if they won' t listen to me ?
We need to muster and train troops here , not send soldiers all over Texas .
Idiots .
They think Santa Anna' s just gonna hand over part of Mexico without a fight ?
( men shouting )
They are gonna want you humble , General .
I humble myself before God , and there the list ends .
To march an expedition between here and Matamoros
- is lunacy !
- ( men shouting )
You do not split an army into vagabond militias that march off on the slightest pretext like bloodthirsty rabble .
Do you really believe this war is over ?
You opposed Bexar , but victory was ours !
( men ) Yeah !
And now you oppose Matamoros , where victory will be as sweet .
No .
Perhaps , sir , you simply oppose fighting .
Fighters shall lead the new country of Texas , sir .
The council will now consider the removal of General Houston from command of the regular army .
- All in favor , show of hands .
- ( majority ) Aye !
The late , great Sam Houston , former governor of Tennessee and now former general of the Texian army .
- Scottish catamite .
- What did you say ?
I called you a Scottish catamite , Grant .
One step down from associate pederast .
- All right .
- ( man ) Remain clothed !
Come for me !
Come !
Come !
Any excuse to start removin ' your clothes , is that right , Houston ?
This is not your concern , Mr. Bowie .
Indeed .
This is between me and the Scottish catamite .
Wanna borrow mine , Grant ?
' Cause I' il surely give it to ya .
Buy you a drink ?
I didn' t know you drank .
You marked the coat as single- breasted , with a four- inch stand collar ?
- ( man ) As you desired , Mr. Travis .
- Lieutenant Colonel .
And the epaulets are gold bullion ?
Should be quite a sight .
Where would you like the uniform sent ?
San Antonio de Bexar .
I' il be there defending the Alamo .
Defend against what ?
The Mexican army left there with their tail between their legs .
Mr. William ... she here .
In your office , waitin ' .
Your wife .
Mr. Bowie !
- Colonel .
- Buck .
Drunken Hottentot .
Two- bit dandy .
( Travis ) Well , the choices are abandonment , adultery , or cruel and barbarous treatment .
I think abandonment' s most accurate .
Any of the choices would be appropriate .
You sure you want to do this ?
Well , we- we signed the papers .
I meant Charlie .
I don' t intend this harshly , but he should have a male example in his life .
I' ve already made arrangements for him to stay with a fine family while I' m away .
Well , we have a long way to travel .
Your father' s becoming a rich man , and he' il be able to see to your education .
You' re makin ' a jackass outta yourself , Sam .
Vindictive sons of bitches .
Texas ... wasted on the Texians .
They' il come back .
The Mexicans .
A well- trained army , against all this handful of amateurs .
Only chance we have is to fight ' em out in the open .
Forts , they' re useless , useless to us .
What is it about that damn place , anyway ?
What place ?
The Alamo .
Every time a sour wind blows through , everybody runs there and hides inside .
Ain' tnothin ' butmud .
Acaved- inchurch .
Andcannon .
Cannon .
Protects my home , Sam .
You don' t have no home , any more than I have .
( Houston sighs )
It' s a damn shame about your wife , Jim .
Am I still your general ?
You know you are .
I want you to return to the Alamo , fetch the cannon back .
Will you do that for me ?
Will you promise that you' il do that for me ?
Yeah .
Now , you mind Mr. and Mrs. Ayers .
Don' t go causing any fuss .
When I return , we' il get a home of our own .
I promise .
" One crowded hour of glorious life is worth an age without a name . "
( woman ) Jim Bowie' s here !
- ( man ) Know which one he is ?
- Right there .
Welcome to San Antonio , Bowie !
- Welcome home , Jim .
- ( woman ) Welcome home , Mr. Bowie .
Welcome home , Jim .
( faint voices and music )
( ^ Spanish music )
( music and voices fade )
( man ) You all right , Mr. James ?
I have a home .
Sir ?
( man ) We know you guys from somewhere ?
( man laughs ) ( man # 2 ) Whoo , that one' s pretty dandy , that one .
Halt !
- Have the quartermaster secure billeting .
- Yes , sir .
- Where you going , sir ?
- I' d like to see what I' m fightin ' for .
Dismount !
It was founded as a mission 100 years ago .
The Bexarenos called it the Alamo , after Alamo de Parras , a Spanish cavalry unit that moved in 30 years ago .
As you can see , it is not designed with military intentions .
She' s well armed .
Most cannon of any fort west of the Mississippi .
I placed our largest , the 1 8- pounder , on the southwest corner , so it fronts the town .
The north wall is in ruins , so I have two batteries with five cannon to defend it .
What was the original convento is now barracks and a makeshift infirmary .
Major Jameson , our engineer , is emplacing a palisade between the main gate and the church .
- What was here before ?
- Nothing .
An indefensible flank .
It still appears indefensible .
Good riflemen and a 12- pounder should hold it .
The church itselfwasn' t built till 1 756 .
It has no roof .
Was it destroyed in battle ?
The Catholics never quite finished it .
Saints Dominic and Francis .
Francis had two gifts : prophecy , and the ability to inspire passionate devotion .
This fort is the only thing that stands between Santa Anna' s army and our settlements .
As goes the Alamo ...
so goes Texas .
If the need arises , I recommend you take my personal quarters on the west wall .
They' re isolated , yet near the primary defenses .
I' m afraid I don' t understand , sir .
I have personal matters to attend to in Mina .
I' m leaving you in command .
I know you fought this posting , Travis .
Forting up is not exactly a cavalryman' s dream .
I' il defend it with my life , sir .
Your biggest task will be keeping the volunteers and the regulars from killin ' one another out of boredom .
The Mexican army would have to cover 300 miles in the dead of winter to get here before I return .
( man shouts in Spanish )
( men laughing )
I got one guy around my neck , I got another guy takin ' off half my ear
- with his one good tooth .
- ( laughter )
The two that I knocked out are now wakin ' up , realizin ' who knocked ' em out .
But I' m fine .
I' m fine .
' Cause I know I got my trusty , loyal Ward right next to me .
So I turn over my shoulder , and who do I find ?
Tortilla lady and her 1 3- year- old hound dog .
( laughter )
Where were ya ?
I hate to tell you this , Jim , but you were in the wrong .
Exactly .
That' s when I need you the most .
( laughter ) ( Bowie coughs )
Oh , God .
I love this place .
I love it , too .
Colonel ?
You look terrible , almost yellow right around the cheeks and forehead .
You a doctor now , along with everything else ?
I' ve heard rumor that you plan to destroy the mission and remove the cannon .
- Where' d you hear that ?
- Men tend to prattle on when they drink .
Your men tend to drink .
It would be a great mistake .
I agree .
And any further discussion on this will be between myself and Colonel Neill .
Colonel Neill left Bexar this morning on personal business .
It' s my command now .
( chuckling )
Well , my , my , my .
That is a swift rise , Billy .
Might as well break out those long britches .
Your men exhibit no discipline .
If matters don' t change , it will become my duty , as colonel of this post ...
Lieutenant colonel .
Restrain your men ... or I will .
( chuckling )
( branch snaps )
? Habla ingles . muchachos ?
( man ) We got ' em , David .
It appears to me that we' re all on the same side here .
What you doin ' out here ?
My name is David Crockett .
Crockett of Tennessee ?
Davy Crockett ?
He prefers " David . "
Now , there was this little detail of a re- election back home .
( crowd ) Aww !
It' s all right .
It' s all right .
- ' Cause you know what I told them folks ?
- ( man ) What' d you tell ' em ?
- I said , " You all can go to hell . "
- ( laughter )
- " I' m goin ' to Texas ! "
- ( crowd ) Yeah !
- Welcome to Texas , Davy .
- Thank you , sir .
- Put your mark on it , Mr. Crockett ?
- ( man ) Look out .
Let me through here .
( Crockett ) Absolutely .
" I' m half alligator , half snappin ' turtle . "
" I can slide off a rainbow and jump the Mississippi in a single leap . "
Tell ' em , Davy , how you can whup your weight in wildcats .
I seen you onstage .
Well , that wasn' t me .
Why ...
Why , sure it was .
No , sir , that was just an actor in a play .
He was performin ' a character .
Aw , come on , Davy .
Say the lines .
Davy Crockett , the Lion of the West .
I dare San- tanna to show his face now you' re here .
Well , I understood the fightin ' was over .
Ain' tit ?

( cheers and applause )
Well done .
You don' t have the sand to even talk to two of my men , much less arrest them .
I told you I intended to restore order .
You' ve got no command over my volunteers .
None .
I have absolute command .
Break ' em out , boys .
Yeah .
' Cause it' s gonna be a cold day in hell anybody takes orders from a debtor who leaves his pregnant wife in the middle of the night .
How about a land swindler who marries a girl , God rest her soul , for her father' s money ?
Whoa , whoa , fellers !
Hey , hey , hey , fellers , now , listen .
Just ' cause we ain' t got nobody to fight don' t mean we need to fight one another .
Congressman Crockett has a point .
We should do this democratically .
A vote .
- What about Colonel Crockett leadin ' us ?
- No , I' m with you fellers , not above you .
All for the lieutenant colonel , raise your hand .
Now , come on , men .
No repercussions .
All infavorofmecommanding .
Andallforme ?
( softly ) All right .
You can command the militia only .
Regulars can' t be led by a volunteer .
It' s illegal .
You don' t like the outcome , you change the rule ?
Is that it , Buck ?
Aw , don' t fret about it , Jim .
We all know who' s in charge .
You know , I don' t know why we had to tent up outside of town when there are so many fine houses with big corn- husk beds just sittin ' empty .
Why are they empty ?
Apparently some of the folks hereabouts seem to think the Mexicans is comin ' back .
Most of the boys think they wouldn' t be here till late spring if they come at all .
- Figure they know something we don' t ?
- Mijito . cierre la puerta y ven para aca .
( bell clanging )
( woman ) Tell me what is going on !
( Bowie wheezes )
We' il never be able to defend the town .
( Travis ) Orderly withdrawal into the Alamo .
- Greys fall in !
- Close up !
Shoulder arms !
Forward !
Forward !
Orderly withdrawal !
Please proceed to the Alamo in an orderly manner .
Don' t run .
You' re fine .

Come on !
Follow me !
( shouting )
Come on !
( knocks )
Colonel ?
I' m sorry to disturb you , but we got quite a mare' s nest out here .
I have to get couriers out while there' s still time .
You and your men will defend the palisade .
The palisade ?
You talkin ' about that little old bunch of sticks over there ?
You prefer a different assignment ?
No , that' s the one
I was gonna put in for .
If you could oversee manning the walls , it would be a help .
We should have six men to a cannon , 18 tubes , - which works out to ...
- 108 men .
And we should have a man with a musket every four feet of wall .
We' re gonna need more men .
( military drumbeats )
( men shouting orders in Spanish )
! Viva Santa Anna !! Viva Mexico !
( man shouting orders in Spanish )
To Gonzales , and to Colonel Fannin at Goliad .
Godspeed .
Sir .
Colonel , you should see this .
( men shouting in Spanish in the distance )
( man shouting orders in Spanish in the distance )
We' re gonna need a lot more men .
What is Colonel Bowie doing on the bridge ?
Tryin ' to talk us out of the spot we' re in .
Fire the 1 8- pounder .
- Sir ?
- You heard me .
Fire the cannon .
Prime the gun .
( mouthing )
Fire !
( shouting in Spanish )
Lo siento .
Manuel .
I had nothing to do with this .
You out of your mind ?
- I' m trying to get us a truce !
- A truce ?
If we broker a cessation , we will do so from a position of strength , not weakness .
- Goddamn !
- We don' t turn belly up and beg .
Otherwise , we have said nothing , and this conflict means nothing .
Dyin' for nothin ' means shit to me .
- Their response ?
- Shit !
( wheezes ) ( man ) David .
Surrender at discretion ...
Buck .
Perhaps , Colonel , they' il only execute the officers .
I think we all just got promoted .
Looky here .
( speaking Spanish )
Within a few days all of Texas will know our situation .
Tell me , Buck , in Alabama , precisely how many is " a few " ?
( laughter ) ( speaking Spanish )
No .
Excelencia .
Ah .
Crockett ?
Si .
Alteza . ! Excelente !
( ^ bagpipes )
( soldier shouting orders in Spanish )
You know , personally , David ,
I' d just as soon take my chances fightin ' out in the open .
Hell , I don' t like being hemmed in any more than you do , but here we sit .
( Bowie ) Avoid cluster at all times .
Keep your eyes set for crossfire .
Pack plenty of grease wrap balls , put ' em in your blocks .
You may be a- firin ' fast , but not yet .
Load all your muskets and stack ' em , but don' t powder ' em .
Ten minutes in this , they' il be nothin ' but sticks , understand ?
Oh ...
And nomoreofthis , byanybody .
Go to it , boys .
- ( coughing ) - Here we go , sir .
Come on , let me help you .
That' s right .
- ( Bowie coughs and wheezes ) - Take it in .
( Bowie coughs )
It burns .
- But , sir ...
- That' s it .
I smell like a skunk' s ass .
Jim , what ails you , exactly ?
Consumption .
Typhoid .
Pneumonia .
One or all .
Exactly .
She' s a dandy , all right .
That knife fight you got into , sand bar over in Natchez ...
It was the one that got you written up .
That all true ?
You believe everything you read now ?
I didn' t read it , I heard it .
And the way I heard it , he put a sword cane and two shots in you .
I don' t remember .
Figure ol ' Sam will be down here pretty soon .
When he gets here , we' il have a good ol ' time .
( coughs )
Itwas three shots .
Sword came through my lung and went through my hand , and then I cut his heart out .
Those ain' t bears out there .
Do you understand that ...
Davy ?
Why in the hell do you suppose they don' t just attack us ?
I seen vaqueros spend all day long just killin ' one bull .
( military drumbeats )
( ^ cavalry march )
You bring a band , you' re countin ' on havin ' something to celebrate .
Mighty nice of ' em to serenade us like this .
It' s a cavalry march , but I' m told Santa Anna fancies it for other uses .
He borrowed it from the Spaniards , the Spaniards from the Moors .
- It' s called " Deguello . " - Kinda pretty .
Deguello means " slit throat . "
Now , ain' t that pretty .

Yes , sir .
Lieutenant , check the main gate for me .
I need a head count for Jim Bowie .
Yes , sir .
( Bowie coughing . gagging )
( spits )
Notice how you can' t really hear it until it stops ?
Until they decide to attack , I suspect we' il be bombarded on a nightly basis .
Deprive us of sleep .
They want you to start seeing ghosts everywhere .
Colonel , I became a little heated with you in front of your men .
It was ill- advised and not terribly professional .
Don' t worry about it .
Most of my men didn' t even understand the words you were usin ' .
It' s important that you and I agree .
For me , though we are poorly supplied , surrender is not an option .
I submit that we engage and delay until reinforcements arrive .
( Bowie chuckles )
Sometimes , it' s just the way you say things , Travis , that' s all .
I swear to God .
( man ) Bring it down !
Down !

Do you notice anything different about them cannon ?

They moved ' em closer last night .
This will be the spot .
As our well is dryin ' , anytime you find yourselves not busy with other matters ,
I need you to be diggin ' a new one here .
Ain' t bad enough we got to fetch ' em the water .
Now we got to find it for ' em , too .
David , you said you wanted to see him .
There he is , the Napoleon of the West .
Which one ?
- That' s Santa Anna ?

He' s quite the peacock , isn' t he ?

At this very moment our soldiers are held in the Alamo against a force of thousands .
They put their hopes in Colonel Fannin . who . despite his pedigree . has proven himself ill- equipped to lead . much less march . an army .
This is from Colonel Travis .
" I call on you in the name of liberty to come to our aid with all dispatch . "
" lf this call is neglected ,
I am determined to sustain myself as long as possible and die like a soldier , who never forgets what is due to his own honor and that of his country : victory or death . "
( Houston ) Gentlemen ...
I will raise an army .
We will relieve the Alamo .
But only after we have declared independence and created a government that can be legally recognized by all the nations of the world .
That ... is what every besieged man in the Alamo is fighting for .
( Travis ) We have no idea if any of our couriers made it out .
- You know the land and the language .
- You are asking me to leave my men .
I' m asking you to deliver a message to Houston and return with a response .
I' m ordering it .
Don' t give him too much water .
He' s just like me .
He drinks too much , he ain' t worth a damn .
I' il bring him back to you , Santiago .
You bring yourself back .
Captain ... go with God .
( whistles )
( coughs )
Makes a man ponder the possibilities , don' t it ?
What happened to your cap ?
Crawl away ?
No .
I only wear it when it' s extra cold .
The truth is ,
I only started wearing that thing ... because of that feller in that play they did about me .
( Bowie coughs )
People expect things .
Ain' titso
- Can I ask you something ?
- All right .
Now , which was tougher , jumping the Mississippi or riding that lightning bolt ?
( cannon fires )
Can you catch a cannonball ?
If it was just me , simple old David from Tennessee ,
I might drop over that wall some night and take my chances .
But that Davy Crockett feller , they' re all watchin ' him .
He' s been on these walls every day of his life .
He' s burning with fever .
Try to get him to drink something not whiskey .
Sam , get me some sheets and cold mud .
I have issued orders for Colonel Fannin to retreat from Goliad .
John Forbes is mustering more men throughout South Texas and bringing them to Gonzales .
I expect 1 500 men to be there when I arrive .
We will march out , circumventing Santa Anna' s army , and relieve the Alamo from the west , withdrawing back to the Colorado and establishing on a line southeast from Beason' s Crossing to Brazoria .
You will have command of the regular army .
The militias will have their own command .
No .
I will command all or none .
You do your calling , and I shall do mine .
I will lead an army .
You will birth a nation .
Gentlemen , to Texas !
( men ) To Texas !
( branch snaps )
Here they come !
Here they come !
Position the cannon !

Over there .
What are they working at ?
When they come over those walls ,
I want you to throw up your hands and holler ,
" Soy negro .
No disparo . "
What' s that ?
Mexican law said there ain' t no slaves , right ?
- Yeah .
- And contract or no , that' s what you is .
Now , the Mexicans see your color , you tell ' em , " Don' t shoot . " They pass you by .
But Mr. William , he gonna give me a gun , and I' il ...
You clean up their shit , you take care of their horses , you wash ' em , you feed ' em .
Damn if you ain' t gonna die for ' em , too .
( clanging )
( Houston ) Where is everybody ?
30 men from here in Gonzales have already left for the Alamo .
Assemblethementhatwehave .
( Houston ) We need more men .
If they arrive every day , soon we will have enough .
But for now , we wait .
If we can' t run , we walk .
If we can' t walk , we crawl .
But we gotta go to the aid of those boys .
It' s only right .
General , I' m the man who left Travis there .
I do not enjoy waiting any more than the next man , but I will not sacrifice Texas .
These 1 24 men cannot pierce an army of thousands .
Colonel Fannin is en route from Goliad with 400 men .
These troops need training .
I suggest that you commence with it .
