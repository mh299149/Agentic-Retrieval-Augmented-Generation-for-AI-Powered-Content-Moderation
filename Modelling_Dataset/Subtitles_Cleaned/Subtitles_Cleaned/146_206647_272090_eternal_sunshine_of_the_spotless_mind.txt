<i>Montauk train on track " B. " </ i>
<i>Random thoughts</ i> <i>for Valentine' s Day , 2004 . </ i>
<i>Today is a holiday invented</ i> <i>by greeting card companies ... </ i>
<i>Last call ... </ i> <i>to make people</ i> <i>feel like crap . </ i>
<i>I ditched work today . </ i>
<i>Took a train out to Montauk . </ i>
<i>Montauk train boarding</ i> <i>on track " B. " </ i>
<i>I don' t know why . </ i>
Aah !
<i>I' m not an impulsive person . </ i>
<i>I guess I just woke up</ i> <i>in a funk this morning . </ i>
<i>I gotta get my car fixed . </ i>
Hi .
Cindy ?
It' s Joel .
Joel !
Listen , I don' t feel very well today .
No , food poisoning , I think .
<i>It' s goddamn freezing on this beach . </ i>
<i>Montauk in February . </ i>
<i>Brilliant , Joel . </ i>
<i>Page is ripped out . </ i>
<i>Don' t remember doing that . </ i>
<i>It appears this is</ i> <i>my fixirst entry in two years . </ i>
<i>Sand is overrated . </ i>
<i>It' s just tiny little rocks . </ i>
<i>If only I could</ i> <i>meet someone new . </ i>
<i>I guess my chances of that happening</ i> <i>are somewhat diminished, </ i> <i>seeing that I' m incapable</ i> <i>of making eye contact</ i> <i>with a woman I don' t know . </ i>
<i>Maybe I should</ i> <i>get back together with Naomi . </ i>
<i>She was nice . </ i>
<i>Nice is good . </ i>
<i>She loved me . </ i>
<i>Why do I fall in love</ i> <i>with every woman I see ... </ i> <i>who shows me</ i> <i>the least bit of attention ? </ i>
Hi .
I' m sorry ?
- I just said hi .
- Hi .
Hello .
Hi .
Okay if I sit closer ?
How far are you going ?
Uh , Rockville Center .
Get out !
Me too !
Really ?
What are the odds ?
Do I know you ?
Do you ever shop at Barnes & Noble ?
Sure .
Sure .
That' s it !
<i>Yeah ? </ i>
I' ve seen you , man !
Book slave there for , like , five years now .
Ah .
I would have thought I would' ve remembered you .
Jesus !
Is it five years ?
It might be the hair .
What might ?
It changes a lot .
The color .
That' s why you might not recognize me .
It' s called Blue Ruin , the color .
Right .
Yeah .
Snappy name , huh ?
<i>I like it . </ i>
Yeah .
Anyway , this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names .
Red ...
Red Menace , Yellow Fever , Green Revolution .
That' d be a job , coming up with those names .
You think there could possibly be a job like that ?
I mean , how many hair colors could there be ?
Fifty , maybe .
Someone' s got that job .
Agent Orange !
I came up with that one .
I apply my personality in a paste .
Oh , I doubt that very much .
Well , you don' t know me , so ... you don' t know , do you ?
Sorry .
I was just ...
I' m trying to be nice .
Yeah .
I got it .
My name' s Clementine , by the way .
I' m Joel .
Hi , Joel .
Hey .
No jokes about my name .
Oh , no , you wouldn' t do that .
You' re trying to be nice .
I don' t know any jokes about your name .
Huckleberry Hound .
I don' t know what that means .
Huckleberry Hound ?
What are you , nuts ?
It' s been suggested .
Oh , my darlin ' , oh , my darlin ' Oh , my darlin ' Clementine
You were lost and gone forever
Dreadful sorry Clementine
No ?
I' m sorry .
Just ...
It' s a pretty name , though .
It really is nice .
It' s , uh ...
It means " merciful . "
Right ?
Clemency ?
Although it hardly fits .
I' m a vindictive little bitch , truth be told .
Gee , I- I wouldn' t think that about you .
Why wouldn' t you think that about me ?
I don' t know .
I just ...
I don' t know .
I just , uh ...
You seem nice , so ...
Oh , now <i>I' m</ i> nice ?
Oh , God .
Don' t you know any other adjectives ?
I don' t need " nice . "
I don' t need myself to be it , and I don' t need anybody else to be it at me .
Okay .
<i>Joel ? </ i>
It' s Joel , right ?
Yes .
I' m sorry I yelled at you .
I' m a little out of sorts today .
My embarrassing admission is ,
I really like that you' re nice right now .
I mean , I can' t tell from one moment to the next what I' m gonna like , but right now ...
I' m glad you are .
I have so much stuff that , uh , I probably should , uh ...
Oh !
I' m sorry .
Okay .
I- I' m writing , and ...
No , no .
I just ...
Sure .
No .
That' s okay .
I just have ...
You know , this is ...
Okay .
- Ohh !
Hey !
- Take care , then .
<i>Jesus ! </ i>
Hi .
I could , uh , give you a ride , if you need .
<i>It' s cold . </ i>
Yeah .
Okay .
Yeah .
<i>Yeah ? </ i>
It is frosty .
You' re not a stalker or anything , right ?
<i>I' m not a stalker . </ i>
You' re the one that talked to me .
Remember ?
That is the oldest trick in the stalker book .
Really ?
There' s a stalker book ?
Mm- hmm .
<i>Okay . </ i>
I gotta read that one .
Look , I' m sorry if I came off sorta nutso .
I' m not , really .
Oh , it' s okay .
I didn' t think you were .
Did you wanna have a drink ?
I have lots of drinks , and I could , um ...
Um ...
Never mind .
Sorry .
That was stupid .
I' m embarrassed now .
No , no , no , no .
Good night , Joel .
<i>Two Blue Ruins . </ i>
Thank you .
Drink up , young man .
It' il make the whole seduction part less repugnant .
I' m just kidding !
Come on .
You' re kinda closed- mouthed , aren' t you ?
I' m sorry .
It' s just , you know , my life isn' t that interesting .
I go to work , I come home .
<i>Don' t know what to say . </ i>
You should read my journal .
I mean , it' s just ... blank .
<i>Really ? </ i>
<i>Does that make you</ i> <i>sad or anxious ? </ i>
I mean , I' m always anxious , thinking I' m not living my life to the fullest , taking advantage of every possibility , making sure I' m not wasting one second of the little time I have .
I think about that .
Yeah ?
You' re really nice .
Ohh !
God , I have to stop saying that .
I' m gonna marry you .
<i>I know it . </ i> <i></ i>
Um ... okay .
Joel , you should come up to the Charles with me sometime .
It gets frozen this time of year .
That sounds scary .
Exactly .
I' il pack a picnic .
A night picnic .
Night picnics are different .
And , um , we could ...
Sounds good .
But I ...
I should , uh , go .
Now .
You should stay .
No , I really ...
I' m ...
I ...
I have to get up so early .
I would like you to call me .
Would you do that ?
I would like it .
Yes .
Wish me a happy Valentine' s Day when you call !
That' d be nice .
What took you so long ?
I just walked in .
Mm- hmm .
You miss me ?
Yeah .
Oddly enough , I do .
Oh !
You said " I do . "
I guess that means were married .
I guess so .
Tomorrow night ?
Honeymoon on ice ?
It' s really solid this time of year .
Whoa !
I don' t know .
Come on .
Come on .
Eee !
Come on .
Come on , come on .
Whew .
Oh .
So beautiful .
<i>Isn' t it ? </ i>
<i>Uh , don' t go too far . </ i>

Oww !
Ow !

Oh !

- Ouch !
Fuck it .
<i>Ohh !
Oh , my ass ! </ i>
I think I should go back .
<i>Come on .
Come on ! </ i>
What if it breaks ?
- " What if " ?
Do you really care right now ?
- Huh ?
<i>Come here .
Please . </ i>
Come on .
Ohh .
Ooh- hoo- hoo- hoo !
Slidy- slidy .
Slidy- slidy .
Whoa !
This is good .
Here , let me show you this one thing .
What are you doing ?
Whoa .
Come on .
Think I heard a crack .
It' s not gonna crack or break or ...
It' s so thick .
Show me which constellations you know .
Um ...
Oh .
I don' t ... know any .
Show me which ones you know .
Okay .
Okay .
Oh .
Here' s Osidius .
Where ?
Right there .
See ?
Sort of a swoop and a cross .
Osidius the Emphatic .
You' re full of shit .
Right ?
Nope .
Osidius is right there .
Swoop and cross .
Shut the fuck up !
Clementine .
Cock- a- doodle- doo .
Hey .

Sorry to wake you , but we' re ... here .
Ahh .

I' m so tired .
Okay .
Um , yeah .
Sure .
Let me get my toothbrush .
Yeah .
Oh .
Just ...
Yes ?
Can I help you ?
What do you mean ?
Can I help you with something ?
No .
What are you doing here ?
I' m not really sure what you' re asking me .
Oh .
Thanks .
<i>I need your lovin' </ i>

<i>Everybody' s gotta learn sometime</ i>
<i>We' re looking for 159 . </ i>
<i> What number' s that ? </ i>
<i>I don' t know where that is . </ i>
<i>Jesus Christ , you' d think</ i> <i>they' d light the number, </ i> <i>or at least put a number on ... </ i>
<i>Is that him ? </ i>
<i> I think so . </ i>
Yeah , that' s him .
Wait .
That' s him .
<i>Hey , Joel . </ i>
Frank .
Oh , shit .
<i>Jesus .
The only</ i> <i>Valentine' s Day cards I get</ i> <i>are from my mother . </ i>
How pathetic is that , huh ?
You' re lucky you have Clementine , man .
She is way cool .
Hey , you got any big Valentine' s Day plans with her ?
No .
Well , it' s only a day away .
Better make some reservations or something .
Don' t want to end up at Mickey D' s .
Right ?
McRomance !
You want some fries with that shake ?
I have to , uh , go to sleep now , Frank .
It' s 8 : 30 .

How pathetic is that ? <i></ i>
You' re lucky you have Clementine , Joel .
Hey , you got , uh , any , uh , big Valentine' s Day plans with her ?
No .
It' s only a day away .
Better make a reservation or something .
Don' t wanna end up at Mickey D' s .
<i>Oh , no ! </ i>
<i> Yes !
Valentine' s Day</ i> <i>is three goddamn days away ! </ i>
<i>I want it resolved . </ i>
<i>I' m willing to be</ i> <i>the one to resolve it . </ i>
So I call her , and she' s changed her number .
<i>So I walked over to Antic Attic, </ i> <i>you know , to get her something . </ i>
<i>I thought I' d go over to work, </ i> <i>give her an early valentine , and ... </ i>
You won' t believe it .
She' s there with ... this guy , this really young guy .
And she looks at me like she doesn' t even know who I am .
Excuse me ?
Can I help you find something , sir ?
<i>Hey , Clem- ato . </ i>
Patrick !
Baby boy .
<i>What you doing here , baby ? </ i> <i></ i> <i>Just came to surprise you . </ i>
Let me know if you need something , sir .
You look good .

<i>Pretty bored .
Pretty tired . </ i>
<i>Uh- huh . </ i>
<i>I so want what' s in your suit . </ i>
<i>Oh , good . </ i>
Why ?
Why would she do that to me ?
Hey , does anybody want a joint ?
Oh , God , Rob , give it a rest .
Oh , God .
She' s punishing me .
I know , honey .
For being honest .
It' s horrible .
I should just go to her house .
<i>No !
No , no , no . </ i>
<i>You don' t wanna go there , man . </ i>
<i>You don' t wanna go there . </ i>
Get off .
It' s too ...
Right .
<i>Yeah . </ i>
I don' t want to seem desperate .
Joel , why don' t you just see this as a sign , make a clean break .
Right ?
Right ? <i></ i>
<i>All right , Joel, </ i> <i>look , man , seriously . </ i>
<i>Rob ! </ i>
Here' s the deal .
Don' t do that .
Rob , what are you doing ?
No , no , no , no .
What' s your fucking suggestion , Carrie ?
What' s your brilliant , reasoned solution ?
You' re gonna make this about our shit now ?
This isn' t about us .
<i>I agree .
It' s not about us . </ i>
<i>It' s aboutJoel , who' s an adult . </ i>
<i>Okay ? </ i>
Not Mama Carrie' s kid .
<i> - What are you ... </ i>
- That' s <i>your</ i> laundry !
<i>That' s great . </ i>
<i>That' s good . </ i> <i></ i>
Okay .
What is it ?
<i> I don' t know . </ i>
<i>It' s some place that does a thing . </ i>
<i>Good morning .
Lacuna . </ i>
<i>No , I' m sorry . </ i>
<i>That offer expired</ i> <i>after the new year . </ i>
Yeah , sure .
We can fit you in ...
How about on the fifth ?
<i>That' s a Wednesday . </ i>
<i>All right , great . </ i>
<i>Could you spell that , please ? </ i>
<i>Okay , and we' il need</ i> <i>a daytime phone number . </ i>
Great .
Have a nice day .
See you then .
May I help you ?
I' m Joel Barish .
<i>Excuse me ? </ i>
I' m Joel .
Barish .
I have an appointment with Dr<i> ... </ i>
Mierzwiak .
- Here .
Could you please fill this out ?
- I just want to talk to him .
You still need to fill the form out , sir .
Really ?
- Thank you .
- Great .
I don' t have a pen .
There' s a pen right there . <i></ i>
<i>Good morning .
Lacuna . </ i>
Oh .
<i>Oh , yeah , that offer .
That' s done now . </ i>
<i>That expired after the new year . </ i>
Mr. Barish ?
How are we today ?
Not too good , actually .
<i>Boo ! </ i>
Oh , my God !
Stan !
Sorry .
Sorry , I was just ...
I' m working !
Sorry .
Sorry .
Here , Doctor .
Thank you .
You should not have seen this .
I apologize .
This is a hoax , right ?
I mean , this is Clem ...
I assure you , no . <i></ i> <i>No . </ i>
Mm- mmm .
There' s no such thing as this .
Look , our files are confidential , Mr. Barish , so I can' t show you evidence .
Suffice it to say that Miss , uh ...
Miss Kruczynski was not happy , and she wanted to move on .
<i>We provide that possibility . </ i>
" Miss Kruczynski was not happy and wanted to move on . <i></ i>
We provide that possibility . "
What the hell is that ?
Nicest guy she ever went out with .
<i>Oww !
Fuck ! </ i>
God , Rob !
Give it a rest !
It' s okay .
It' s all right .
Carrie , I am making a birdhouse .
<i>What can I say , Joel ? </ i>
<i>You know Clementine .
She' s like that . </ i>
She' s impulsive .
She decided to erase you almost as a lark .
A lark .
Why ?
Why ?
Why ?
Why did you do that ?
<i>Wait , wait , wait , wait ! </ i>
I' m sorry , Doctor .
He just barged right in here .
Okay .
I want it done .
I told him pre- Valentine' s Day is our busy time .
- Oh , th- th- that' s ... that' s okay , Mary .
- But there are people waiting .
Mr. Barish , if you' d like to , uh ... to come inside .
And , Mary , if you could take care of Mrs. Woo .
Good- bye , Mrs. Woo .
<i>Yes , of course . </ i>
Now , the , uh ... the first thing we need you to do , Mr. Barish , <i>is to go home ... </ i> <i>and collect everything you own</ i> <i>that has some association with Clementine . </ i>
<i>Anything . </ i>
<i>And we' il use these items to create</ i> <i>a map of Clementine in your brain . </ i>
<i>Okay ? </ i>
<i>So we' il need , uh, </ i> <i>uh , photos , clothing , gifts, </ i> <i>books she may have bought you, </ i> <i>CDs you may have bought together, </ i> <i>journal entries . </ i>
<i>We want to empty your home ... </ i>
<i>We want to empty your</ i> life <i>of Clementine . </ i>
<i>And after the mapping is done, </ i> <i>our technicians will do the erasing</ i> <i>in your home tonight . </ i>
<i>That way , when you awake</ i> <i>in the morning, </ i> <i>you' il fixind yourself in your own bed</ i> <i>as if nothing had happened ... </ i> <i>a new life awaiting you . </ i>
Wake up , buddy !
<i>No , I' m sorry , Mrs. Sobel . </ i>
<i>You can' t have the procedure done</ i> <i>three times in one month . </ i>
Well , it' s just not our policy ...
How are you today , Mr. Barish ?
<i>Hello .
I' m right here . </ i>
I know it' s an emergency , and we' il do everything we can ...
We can fit you in on the first of March .
<i>Maybe you could talk to the doctor, </ i> <i>a - and he ... </ i>
<i>All right , so let' s make an appointment . </ i>
<i>What day would you like</ i> <i>to come in this week ? </ i>
Mr. Barish .
Um , he' s really busy this afternoon .
<i>Maybe tomorrow would be better . </ i>
<i>Around 12 : 15 ?
Can you do that ? </ i>
February is very busy for us because of Valentine' s Day .
This is , uh , Stan Fink , <i>one of our most experienced</ i> <i>and skilled technicians . </ i>
He' il be handling your case tonight .
Great to meet you , Mr. Barish .
My name is Joel Barish , and I' m here to erase Clementine Kruczynski .
Very good .
Now , tell me about , uh , Clementine .
Uh , I was ...
living with this woman , Naomi , uh , a couple years ago , and my friends Rob and Carrie invited us to this party at the beach ...
I don' t like parties .
<i>Naomi couldn' t go , but I went ... </ i> <i>and I , uh , met Clementine . </ i>
I' m sorry .
Let' s start with your most recent memories ... and work backwards from there , more or less .
There' s an emotional core ... to each of our memories , and when you eradicate that core it starts its degradation process .
By the time you wake up in the morning , all the memories we' ve targeted will have withered and disappeared , as in a dream upon waking .
Is there any risk of brain damage ?
Well , uh , technically speaking , the procedure <i>is</ i> brain damage , but it' s on a par with a night of heavy drinking .
Nothing you' il miss .
Comfortable ?
What we' re doing here , Mr. Barish , is actually creating a map of your brain .
<i>Okay , let' s get started . </ i>
<i>If we want to get</ i> <i>this procedure underway tonight, </ i> <i>we have some work to do . </ i>
I want you to react to these objects , Mr. Barish , if you will .
There' s a good story behind this one ...
Uh , actually , Mr. Barish , I' il get a much better emotional readout ... if you refrain from any sort of verbal description of the items .
Just try to focus on the memories .
Oh .
Sorry .
Okay .
<i>Healthy activity up there again . </ i>
<i>Healthy readouts .
Very good . </ i>
- Here' s another object . <i>- </ i> <i>That' s so ... </ i>
Next item .
Okay .
Potato head .
- Next item .
Okay . <i>- </ i>
<i>Just focus on the memories . </ i>
<i>Patrick , do me a favor . </ i>
<i> Hey , Patrick, </ i> <i>do me a favor , will ya ? </ i>
<i> Yeah . </ i>
<i>Can you check the voltage regulator ? </ i>
<i>What do we got there ? </ i>
Uh , voltage looks fine .
Really ?
Well , I' m not wiping as clean as I like here .
I' m ...
<i>Well , uh , technically the procedure</ i> is <i>brain damage . </ i>
Check the , uh ...
Check the connections , please .
Oh , there you are .
I ...
Why am I ...
I don' t understand what I' m looking at .
Why am I standing here and ...
Oh , my God .
Déjà vu .
Déjà vu .
This is so ...
All right , we should get started .
If we' re gonna get the procedure ...
Underway tonight , we have some work to do .
I' m in my head already , aren' t I ?
I suppose so .
Uh , this is about right .
This is what it ...
This is what it would look like .
Very good .
We' il dispose of these mementos when we' re done here .
That way you won' t be confused later by their unexplainable presence in your home .
Ah , there we go .
Patrick ?
<i>Yeah ? </ i>
<i>Patrick , can you check ... </ i>
Patrick ?
<i>I' m getting some sort of readout</ i> <i>of my own voice . </ i>
Patrick ?
Patrick ?
- Why are there so many wires ?
<i> - A lot of equipment . </ i>
- Does that help ?
<i> - Are you sure</ i> <i>you set that thing up properly ? </ i>
<i> How' s that ? </ i>
<i> How are you today, </ i> <i>Mr .
Barish ? </ i>
There we are , Mr. Barish .
<i> That' s better . </ i>
- I don' t know if I like this .
- Think I might try this , then .
We' re almost done now .
<i>Mmm .
Journal . </ i>
<i>That would be invaluable . </ i>
<i>" I met someone tonight . </ i>
<i>I don' t know what to do . </ i>
<i>Her name is Clementine, </ i> <i>and she' s amazing . " </ i>
- Whoa !
Jesus !
What ?
What ?
Come on !
Careful !
Step back !
<i>Just take it easy . </ i>
That' s fine .
Let' s not roach the guy .
All right , you got that one .
This place is sort of a dump , don' t you think ?
<i>It' s an apartment , Patrick . </ i>
Patrick .
<i>Well , not a dump , then, </ i> <i>but sorta plain .
Uninspired . </ i>
<i>And there' s sort of</ i> <i>a stale smell . </ i>
<i>Patrick , can we just please</ i> <i>get through this ? </ i>
We got a very long night ahead of us .
Come on .
<i>Yeah .
Yeah . </ i>
<i>This is the last time I saw you . </ i>
It' s 3 : 00 .
<i>I kinda sorta wrecked your car . </ i>
<i>Were you driving drunk ? </ i>
<i>It' s pathetic . </ i>
<i>I was a little tipsy . </ i>
<i>Don' t call me pathetic . </ i>
Well , it is pathetic .
It' s fucking irresponsible .
Could' ve killed somebody .
<i> Oh , God . </ i>
Maybe you <i>did</ i> kill somebody .
Should we turn on the news and see ?
<i>Oh , Christ ! </ i>
<i>Should I check the grill to see</ i> <i>if there' s any children or small animals ? </ i>
I didn' t kill anybody !
It' s just a fucking dent , Joel .
You' re like an old lady or something .
Well , what are <i>you</ i> like ?
A wino ?
<i>A wino ? </ i>
Jesus , are you from the ' 50s or something ?
A <i>wino ? </ i>
Face it , Joely .
You' re freaked out because I was out late without you , and in your little wormy brain ... you' re trying to figure out , did she fuck someone tonight ?
No , see , Clem ,
I assume you fucked someone tonight .
Isn' t that how you get people to like you ?
<i>I' m sorry .
Okay ? </ i>
Clem , I didn' t mean it .
All right ?
Clem ?
<i>Your keys . </ i>
I was just ...
I was just ...
I won' t need them anymore .
Angry or annoyed or something , I don' t know .
Clem ?
<i></ i> <i>Got it . </ i>
Mary' s coming over tonight .
<i>Yeah ? </ i>
Yeah .
<i>Just thought you' d wanna know . </ i>
<i>I like Mary .
I like when she comes to visit . </ i>
<i>I just don' t think she likes me . </ i>
She likes you okay .
Maybe I should invite my girlfriend over .
I have a girlfriend now .
Do whatever you want .
Did I tell you I have ...
Yeah .
Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend ?
We gotta focus here , Patrick .
Yeah , the thing is , our situation is ... is a little weird .
My girlfriend situation .
I' m sure it is .
You gotta be ...
Clem , let me drive you home .
<i>Get out of my face , faggot ! </ i>
<i>Look at it out here ! </ i>
<i>It' s all falling apart ! </ i>
I' m erasing you , and I' m happy !
You did it to me first !
I can' t <i>believe</ i> you did this to me .
Goddamn it .
Clem !
Can you hear me ?
By morning you' il be gone !
The perfect ending to this piece- of- shit story !
<i> Is there something wrong</ i> <i>with a girl being attracted to me ? </ i>
<i>Is that a problem ? </ i>
<i>No , I think it' s ... funny . </ i>
<i>So , who do you think' s better- looking, </ i> <i>me or this guy ? </ i>
<i>Patrick , let' s focus , buddy . </ i>
<i>Remember that girl</ i> <i>we did last week ? </ i>
<i>The one with the ... potatoes ? </ i>
That <i>girl ? </ i>
<i>That' s this guy' s girl . </ i>
<i>Right . </ i>
<i> Yeah . </ i>
<i>Was .
We took care of that . </ i>
Oh , God !
<i>Well , uh ... </ i>
I kinda fell in love with her that night .
What ?
You little fuck ...
What ?
She was unconscious , man .
Well , she was beautiful , and ...
I stole a pair of her panties as well .
Jesus !
What ?
It' s not like ...
I mean , they were clean and all .
Don' t tell me this stuff , man !
I don' t wanna hear this shit !
<i>They were clean ! </ i>
<i> What ?
D- Don' t !
Stop ! </ i>
<i>Okay .

<i>You what ? </ i>
Jesus .
<i>Jesus , Patrick ! </ i>
<i>Do you have ... any idea ... </ i> how unethical ...
It' s not really that bad .
What ?
Get that look off your face .
What' s wrong ?
<i>Patrick , you stole a girl' s panties ! </ i>
There' s someone here .
He stole your underwear .
I don' t see anyone .
<i>Joel ? </ i>
<i>Where are my boots ? </ i>
<i>Why are you showing me poisons ? </ i>
<i>Can' t you understand English ? </ i>
" Potions , " I said .
Potions .
<i>Love potion , please . </ i>
I' m fucking crawling out of my skin !
Should' ve left you at the flea market .
<i>First thing to do is ... </ i>
<i>Sift in a cup</ i> <i>of powdered whale heart . </ i>
Wanna go ?
I want to have a baby .
Let' s talk about it later .
No !
I want to have a baby .
I don' t think we' re ready .
You' re not ready .
Clem , do you really think you could take care of a kid ?
What ?
I don' t wanna talk about it here .
I can' t hear you .
I can never the fuck understand what you' re saying .
I don' t wanna talk about this !
Fucking ventriloquist !
We' re fucking <i>gonna</ i> talk about it !
I ... don' t ... want ... to ...
You can' t just say something like that and say you don' t wanna talk about it !
I' m sorry , Clem .
I' d make a fucking good mother !
I love children , I' m creative and smart , and I' d make a fucking great mother !
Oh , God ...
Mmm !
It' s you , Joel .
It' s <i>you</ i> who can' t commit to anything !
It' s going !
It' s going !
You have no idea how lucky you are I' m interested in you !
Maybe I should end this right here , Joel !
Leave you at the flea market with this stupid costume jewelry !
It' s done .
This is crap .
Maybe you could find yourself an antique rocking chair to die in !
All the pain , confusion ...
Oh .
Hi , Patrick .
Hi , Mary .
How' s it goin ' ?
<i>Hey , you . </ i>
Oh , it' s freezing outside .
<i>Find us okay ? </ i>
<i> Yeah . </ i>
Mmm .
Hot !
Poor guy .
Mmm ?
Oh .
Don' t you have anything real to drink ?
<i>Uh , we haven' t really</ i> <i>checked yet . </ i>
Patrick ?
Uh , yeah .
Uh , let me do the honors .
Mary hates me .
Never really had much luck with the ladies .
Maybe if you stop stealing their panties . <i></ i> <i>Stan .
Stan . </ i>
There' s more .
No !
Yes .
No !
Hey , hey ! <i></ i>

Wait .
" Blessed are the forgetful , for they get the better even of their blunders . "
Oh .

That' s Nietzsche .
<i>Beyond Good and Evil . </ i>
I found it in my <i>Bartlett' s . </ i>
What' s your <i>Bartlett' s ? </ i>
It' s a quote book , Patrick .
It' s a book of quotations .
I think Howard will be in <i>Bartlett' s</ i> one day .
Definitely .
Howard is pure <i>Bartlett' s . </ i> <i></ i> <i>God ! </ i>
Can you wake him up ?
<i>You can' t wake him up . </ i> <i></ i>
Mmm .
You don' t tell me things , Joel .
I' m an open book .
I tell you everything .
Every damn embarrassing thing .
You don' t trust me .
Constantly talking isn' t necessarily communicating .
I don' t do that .
I want to know you .
Hmm ?
I don' t constantly talk .
Jesus !
People have to share things , Joel .
Mm- hmm .
That' s what intimacy is .
I' m really pissed that you said that to me .
I' m sorry .
It just ... really just isn' t that interesting .
<i>I wanna read some of those journals</ i> <i>you' re constantly scribbling in . </ i>

No .
No .
Thank you .

Patrick .
<i>Hey , Tangerine . </ i>
<i>Oh , Patrick , it' s you . </ i>
<i>I' m so miserable right now . </ i>
<i>Why ?

Excuse me ?

<i>Can I help you</ i> <i>fixind something , sir ? </ i>
<i>Confused ?
What are you confused about ? </ i>
<i>Everything' s fixine . </ i>
Baby , come here .
<i>Scared of what ? </ i>
<i>Do you love me ? </ i>
<i> Of course I do . </ i>
Where' s the self- help section ?
<i>Do you think I' m ugly ? </ i>
<i>No !
You' re beautiful ! </ i>
<i>Maybe I should come over . </ i> <i></ i> <i>No , no . </ i>
<i>I don' t know . </ i>
<i>I - I' m a mess , Patrick . </ i>
<i>Well , just let me come over . </ i>
<i>I' il cheer you up . </ i>
<i>Okay . </ i>
Stan , can I leave for a while ?
My girlfriend' s really upset .
We' re right in the middle of erasing this poor man' s ...
Let him go , Stan !
Let him go .

<i>See ? </ i>
How hard can it be ?
<i> - She hates me . </ i>
<i>She wants me to go . </ i>

You like ?
Oh , man !
I matched my sweatshirt exactly .
I like it .
<i>You do ? </ i>
You look like a tangerine .
Ohh !
" Clemen- teen " the tangerine .
Mmm !
Juicy !
And seedless .
I like that .
I like tangerines !
Can you see me doing ducks ?
Tangerine .
Joel .
Ducks .
Quack- quack .
How does he know to call you that ?
How did who know ?
Oh , my God .
Clem ? <i></ i> <i>This is pretty cool . </ i>
That' s what they called themselves .
The Clash ... the only band that mattered .
They called themselves that for a reason .
It' s amazing , isn' t it ?
Like social justice ...
Yeah , it' s totally incredible .
What Howard gives to the world .
Yeah . <i></ i>
To let people begin again .
It' s beautiful .
You look at a baby , and it' s so pure and so free and so clean .
And adults are , like , this mess of sadness ... and ... phobias .
Howard just makes it all go away .
<i>Oh , my God . </ i>
Baby , what' s going on ?
I don' t know .
I don' t know !
I' m lost , I' m scared ,
I feel like I' m disappearing .
<i>Disappearing ? </ i>
My skin' s coming off !
I' m getting old !
Nothing makes any sense to me !
<i>You' re not getting old . </ i>
Nothing makes any sense .
Nothing makes any sense .
Ohh , Tangerine .
Nothing makes any sense .
Nothing makes any sense , Patrick .
It' s okay .
It' s okay .
Hey , let' s go out dancing .
Yeah ?
You wanna go out to Montauk with me ?
Montauk ?

Come up to Boston with me .
Sure .
Yeah .
We can go next weekend .
No , no .
Now .

<i>Hi , it' s Joel . </ i>

W- W- W- W- Whoa .
Hold on , hold on , hold on .
Hello ?
Yeah , what' s up ?
<i>I got into a little situation</ i> <i>with the old lady . </ i>
Can you handle things tonight alone ?
I' m really sorry , man .

It' s just my taste .
Really .
I' ve never gone out with a guy who bought me a piece of jewelry I liked .
Thank you .
Let' s go .
Okay .
Joely ?
Yeah , Tangerine ?
<i>Am I ugly ? </ i>
Mm- mmm .
<i>When I was a kid, </ i> <i>I thought I was . </ i>
Can' t believe I' m crying already .
<i>Sometimes I think people</ i> <i>don' t understand how lonely it is</ i> <i>to be a kid . </ i>
<i>Like you don' t matter . </ i>
<i>So , I' m eight ... </ i> <i>and I have these toys, </ i> <i>these dolls . </ i>
<i>My favorite is this ugly girl doll</ i> <i>who I call Clementine . </ i>
<i>And I keep yelling at her : </ i>
" You can' t be ugly !
Be pretty ! "
<i>It' s weird . </ i>
<i>Like if I can transform her, </ i> <i></ i>
<i>I would magically change too . </ i>
You' re pretty .
Joely , don' t ever leave me .
Pretty .
Pretty .
Pretty .
Pretty .
<i>Mierzwiak , please</ i> <i>let me keep this memory . </ i>

Whoa !
Stop it !
I could die right now , Clem .
I' m just ... happy .
I' ve never felt that before .
Mmm .
I' m just exactly ... where I wanna be .
Clem ?
I wanna call it off .
I' il give you a sign .
I wanna call it off !
Can you hear me ?
I don' t want this anymore !
I wanna call it off !
<i>When you ain' t got nothing to do</ i>

I have an idea of how to stop this .
Stop what ?
Joely .
Come on , Clem .
Smell my armpit !
Smell my armpit !
No !
Don' t tickle me !
Don' t make me smell you .
Smell my pits !
No .
Good .
Concentrate , Clem .
<i>We gotta get back</ i> <i>to the office . </ i>
<i>There was a tape recorder . </ i>
<i>No , not the picture . </ i>
Not the picture .
Where is it ?
Back here .
Come on !
<i>Oh , look at me . </ i>
<i>Hey , I look good there . </ i>
<i>Look , our fixiles are confidential, </ i> <i>Mr .
Barish, </ i> <i>so I can' t show you evidence . </ i>
<i>Suffice it to say that Miss , uh ... </ i>
<i>Miss Kruczynski ... </ i> <i>was not happy</ i> <i>and she wanted to move on . </ i>
<i>Good .
Now , tell me about Clementine . </ i> <i></ i> <i>Just tell me everything you remember . </ i>

No , wait .
Oh , look !
Hey !
Shit !
We' re going to see my grandma .
Joel , why ...
No , I don' t want to ...
Joel , please !
We' re not going on a train .
Don' t make me run anymore .
Come on !
Mierzwiak !
Do we always have to run ?
Mierzwiak !
Please .
So , why don' t we begin by you telling me ... <i>everything you can remember . </ i>
<i>Mierzwiak !
Wake me up ! </ i>
Oh , I- I' m sorry , Mr. Barish .
<i>I thought you understood</ i> <i>what was going on here . </ i>
I don' t know .
You' re erasing her from me .
You' re erasing me from her ...
I don' t know .
You' ve got this thing .
I' m in my bed .
I know it .
I' m in my brain .
<i>I' m part of your imagination too , Joel . </ i>
How can I help you from there ?
<i>Uh , I' m inside your head too . </ i>
<i>I' m you . </ i>
<i>Sorry . </ i>
Look .
Who' s that ?
Oh , he- he works for us .
That' s , uh , Pa- a- a- a- atrick , <i>baby boy . </ i>
He' s stealing my identity .
He stole my stuff .
He' s , uh , seducing my girlfriend with my words and my things .
He stole her underwear .
Oh , Jesus Christ !
He stole her underwear .
I could die right now , Clem .
I' m just happy .
I' ve never felt that before .
I' m just exactly where I want to be .
I want to go home .
Hey .
What ?
Clem !
Wait .
Clem !
Clem ?
<i>They' re erasing you . </ i> <i></ i>
I' m here !
Clem , focus .
I hired them , okay ? <i></ i>
I' m so stupid .
Sweetie , calm down .
Enjoy the scenery .
<i>I need it to stop before I wake up</ i> <i>and I don' t know you anymore . </ i>
Okay , well , you know , just tell them to cancel it then .
What the hell are you talking about ?
I can' t just cancel it .
I' m asleep .
Wake yourself up !
Okay .
You want me to wake up ?
Okay .
Great .
All right .
Okay , here we go .
This make you happy if I try ?
<i>Yeah . </ i>
I' il try really hard .
Here we go .
That was a great idea .

<i> Oh , my goodness . </ i>
<i>Oh , my God .
What is that ? </ i>
<i>Jesus Christ !
What the ... </ i>
<i>It' s a birthmark ! </ i>
It did work , for a second , but I couldn' t ...
I couldn' t move .
<i>See ? </ i>
Oh , well , isn' t that just another one ofJoel' s self- fulfilling prophecies ?
It' s more important to prove me wrong than to actually ...
Look , I don' t want to discuss this right now , okay ?
Fine .
Then what ?
I' m listening .
I don' t know .
You erased me .
That' s why I' m here .
That' s why I' m doing this in the first place .
I' m sorry .
You ...
You !
You know me .
I' m impulsive .
That' s what I love about you .
<i></ i> <i>Joel ? </ i>
<i> Mm- hmm ? </ i>
<i>I have another idea</ i> <i>for this problem . </ i>
This is a memory of me , the way you wanted to have sex on the couch after you looked down at my crotch .
What ?
Joel , the eraser guys are coming here , so what if you take me somewhere else , somewhere where I don' t belong , and we hide there till morning ?
Oh , man .
I can' t remember anything without you .
Tsk , that' s very sweet , but try , okay ?
Okay .

What Patrick guy ?
That guy !
What ?
He' s here in my apartment .
He' s one of those eraser guys .
He fell for you when they were doing you , and now he' s introduced himself like he doesn' t even know you , and you guys are dating .
Really ?
Is he cute ?
Clem , there' s nothing wrong with you .
You' re the most wonderful person I' ve ever met .
You ...
You' re kind ,
Beautiful ... and smart and funny ... and ... nice .

Those eyedrops you gave me didn' t do shit .
Be cool .
Cool .
Hello , Mary .
What are you doing here ?
<i>Oh , hi , Howard . </ i>
She was just here to help out .
I wanted to understand as much as I could about the procedure as possible .
I think it' s important for my job to understand the inner workings ... <i>of the work that we do . </ i>
Well , not that <i>I</ i> do , but the work that is done ... by people ... where I also work , the work of my colleagues .
All right , well , let' s see if we can , uh , get to the bottom of this , shall we ?
Uh , yeah .
Um ...
Well , that' s odd .
I already tried that .
Did you try going through the C- gate ?
<i>Yeah , of course . </ i>
I mean ... yes .
Yeah .
All right .
You want to get linked up ?
Yeah .
All right .
I already ...
I ran the utility programs , and I had nothing there , so I checked all the memories against the printed logs .
<i>Here , Howard . </ i>
Okay .
I got you a chair .
There you go .
Oh , thank you .
You' re welcome .
Whew !
All right , I' m gonna ...
I' m gonna go through the entire memory , <i>see if something comes up . </ i>
Oh , my darling Oh , my darling
Oh , my darling Clementine
You were lost and gone forever I love being bathed in the sink .
Dreadful sorry , Clementine Such a feeling of security .
I' ve never seen you happier , babyJoel .
Hmm !
There it is .
I don' t understand why it' s off the map like that .
What the heck was he doing there ?
<i>His eyes are open . </ i>
- Has this happened before with him ?
<i> - No . </ i>
Oh , this is ... this is not good .
No .
I' m gonna have to ...
I' m gonna have to give him this .
Can' t you see I love you , Antoine ?
<i>Okay , we' re back in . </ i>
<i>Wow .
That was beautiful</ i> <i>to watch , Howard . </ i>
Like a surgeon or a concert pianist or something .
Thank you , Mary .
Um , Howard , you should get some sleep .
I- I think I' il be fine now .
<i>Why can' t you see I love you, </ i> <i>Antoine ? </ i>
Hmm .
Lucky me .
Lay one on me .
Don' t call me Antoine .
<i>My name is Wally . </ i>
<i>Yes , I know, </ i> <i>but how can a woman love a man</ i> <i>with a name like Wally ? </ i>
<i>Oh !
Oh !
What was that ? </ i>
<i>Hey . </ i>
<i>My God , there' s people</ i> <i>coming out of your butt . </ i>
<i>There is ? </ i> <i></ i>
- Got it .
- Tangerine !
What , Joel ...
What are you doing ?
We gotta go .
Go on .
Please , please , go .
Please go !
You can run , but you can' t hide .
Clem , come on !
There I am .
That truck .
Doc ?
Please .
<i>All right , let' s begin</ i> <i>by you telling me ... </ i> everything you remember ...
That' s strange .
He' s in a memory that we' ve already erased .
Oh , well , at least we know where he is .
He' s back on track , right ?
Come on , Clem .
<i>He seems to have developed some sort</ i> <i>of resistance to the procedure . </ i>
<i>I don' t want to run anymore . </ i>
Shit .
Come on , come on .
Hide me somewhere deeper , somewhere really buried .

We' re playing . </ i>
<i>Hi , Joel' s mom . </ i>
<i>He' s killing me . </ i>
<i>It' s not real . </ i>
<i>Okay , are you dead yet ? </ i>
<i>You' re dead ! </ i> <i></ i>
Uh , I think I got the hang of this .
I still don' t understand it , but I' m finding him quickly enough .
<i>Clem ! </ i> <i></ i>
Clem !
Jo ...
Joely ?
Are you okay , Joel ?
Joel ?
Joel ?
Oh , my God .
That was terrible .
Okay , okay .
That was like three seconds .
<i>All right . </ i>
<i>Let me do it one more time . </ i>
One more , then I get to go .
Okay .
Whoo- hoo- hoo !
Whoo !
Look at this .
This is so cool !
Cool .

<i>Come on . </ i>
Come on .
We gotta go !
Whoo !
Come on !
We gotta go .
Clem ?
We gotta go .
Aah !
Come on !
No !
This is a really bad time for this !
Get off me !
Oh , God !
I don' t even know where we' re going .
It' s gonna be fun .
Come on .
It' s the best place .
No , this way .
No , this way .
No , no , no .
This way .
You' re no help at all .
What' s wrong with you ?
Let go of me , Joel !
I like watching you work , Howard .
I guess , uh ...
I guess I' il go out for ... for some air , if nobody minds .
It looks like you have everything under control here .
Yeah , that' s , uh ... <i>that' s fixine . </ i>
<i>Do you like quotes , Howard ? </ i>
What do you mean ?
<i>Oh , you know, </ i> <i>like famous quotes ? </ i>
I find reading them inspirational , and in my reading , I' ve come across some I thought you might like too .
Oh , well , I ...
I' d love to hear some .
<i>There' s one that goes, </ i>
" Blessed are the forgetful , for they get the better even of their blunders . "
<i>That' s Nietzsche , right ? </ i>
Yeah .
And here I thought I could tell you something you didn' t know .
Oh , no .
It' s ...
It' s a good quote .
I' m happy we both know it .
Yeah .
Oh , and there' s this other one I like .
It' s by Pope Alexander , and it goes ...
<i>Alexander Pope ? </ i>
Oh , yeah .
<i>Yeah , shit . </ i>
<i>It' s just that I told myself</ i> <i>not to say " Pope Alexander" </ i> <i>and sound like a dope, </ i> and then I go ahead and say it .
It' s no big deal .
You' re such a sweetheart .
<i>The quote goes , " How happy is</ i> <i>the blameless vestal' s lot ? </ i>
<i>" The world forgetting, </ i> <i>by the world forgot . </ i>
<i>" Eternal sunshine</ i> <i>of the spotless mind . </ i>
<i>Each prayer accepted</ i> <i>and each wish resigned . " </ i>
<i>I want to be</ i> <i>a great big , huge elephant ... </ i> <i>with a huge trunk like that . </ i>
Clem ?
Clementine ?
I haven' t heard that one .
It' s lovely .
I just thought it would be appropriate , maybe .
I really admire the work you do , Howard .
I don' t mean to be so familiar .
Oh , it' s fine .
It' s fine .
I- I- I- I- I ...
I' m happy to hear ...
I' m sorry .
I' ve loved you for a very long time .
I shouldn' t have said that .
<i>Oh , Mary , no . </ i>
<i>It' s ...
You' re a wonderful girl . </ i>
But I ...
You know , I have a wife and kids .
You know I have a wife and kids .
<i>Oh , Mary . </ i>
Oh , Mary , we can' t do this .
Oh , whoa .
Well , good morning , Mrs. Mierzwiak .
<i>What ? </ i>
<i>Oh , my God ! </ i>
<i>Who is it ? </ i>
Uh ...
Thank you , Stan .
Thanks a lot .
Hollis .
Hollis ! <i></ i>
<i>Hollis ! </ i>
Wait .
Wait , wait , wait .
Hollis .
- I knew it , Howard .
- Hollis , it didn' t start out to be like this .
I came here to work .
Hollis , this is a one- time mistake !
<i>I' m a stupid girl</ i> <i>with a stupid crush ! </ i>
Yeah .
I swear I basically forced him into it !
Don' t be a monster , Howard .
Tell the girl .
Tell me what ?
Oh , you poor kid .
You can have him .
You did .
What ?
Oh , uh ,
we have a history .
I' m sorry .
Y- You wanted the procedure .
You ...
You wanted it done ... so you could get past , uh ...
You could ...
Yeah .
Um , I have to , uh , finish the work in there .
It' s almost morning .
We' il talk later .
Okay ?
<i>Hey . </ i>
Let me give you a lift home .
Fuck this thing .
Damn it .
Hi .
Hi .
Didn' t figure you' d show your face around me again .
I guess I thought you were ... humiliated .
You did run away , after all .
<i>I just needed to see ya . </ i>
Yeah ?
I' d like to , um , take you out or something .
You' re married .
Not yet .
Not married .
No , I' m not married , no .
Look , man , I' m telling you right off the bat I' m high maintenance , so I' m not gonna tiptoe around your marriage ... or whatever it is you' ve got going there .
If you wanna be with me , you' re with me .
Okay .
Too many guys think I' m a concept , or I complete them , or I' m gonna make them alive .
But I' m just a fucked- up girl who' s looking for my own peace of mind .
Don' t assign me yours .
I remember that speech really well .
I had you pegged , didn' t I ?
You had the whole human race pegged .
Hmm .
Probably .
I still thought you were gonna save my life , even after that .
Mmm .
I know .
It would be different ... if we could just give it another go around .
Remember me .
Try your best .
Maybe we can .
Okay , so just tell me what you remember , and , uh , then we' il take it from there .
Okay .
I liked you immediately .
<i>You didn' t</ i> <i>come on to me at all . </ i>
<i>I liked that . </ i>
<i>I was so tongue- tied</ i> <i>around you at fixirst . </ i>
<i>I wanted you to think</ i> <i>I was smart . </ i>
I couldn' t wait to come to work .
I had these fantasies of us being married ... and having kids and ... just ...
<i>Oh , Howie , I can' t do this . </ i>
<i>We agreed it' s for the best , Mary . </ i>
<i>Yeah , I know . </ i>
<i>Oh , God . </ i>
I' il take the bottom and you ...
Uh- uh- uh !
No , no , no .
Here .
I can take that .
So you want me to carry that ?
Help me with that .
Can you get the cooler ?
Honey , the cooler is ...
That' s light , huh ?
Oh , I can get that .
You can get it .
No , no , no , no !
Don' t take anything .
I can take the plane .
Put the thing up .
Put the gate back up .
<i>This is the day we met . </ i>
<i>You were down by the surf . </ i>
<i>I couldjust make you out</ i> <i>in the distance . </ i>
<i>I remember being drawn to you</ i> <i>even then . </ i>
<i>I thought , " Wow , how odd . </ i>
<i>I' m drawn to someone' s back . " </ i>
<i>You were in that orange sweatshirt</ i> <i>that I would come to know so well ... </ i> <i>and even hate , eventually . </ i>
At the time I thought , " How cool !
An orange sweatshirt . "
Hi there .
Hi .
I saw you sitting over here ... by yourself , and I thought , " Thank God .
Someone normal who doesn' t know how to interact at these things either . "
Yeah .
I don' t ever know what to say .
I' m Clementine .
Can I borrow a piece of your chicken ?
And then you just took it ... without waiting for an answer .
It was so intimate ,
like we were already lovers .
I' m Joel .
Hi , Joel .
So , no jokes about my name .
You mean like ...
Oh , my darling , oh , my darling Oh , my darling Clementine
Huckleberry Hound , that sort of thing ?
Yeah .
Like that .
Oh , no jokes .
No jokes .
One of my favorite things when I was a kid was my Huckleberry Hound doll .
<i>Oh . </ i>
I think your name is magical .
This is it , Joel .
It' s gonna be gone soon .
I know .
What do we do ?
Enjoy it .
You married ?
No .
Let' s move into this neighborhood !
I do sort of live with someone though .
Male or female ?
What ?
Female .
Female .
At least I' m not barking up the wrong tree .
You know these people ?
No , of course not .
Come on .
They might have a dog .
There' s no dog .
What are you doing ?
It' s freezing out .
<i>I can' t believe this . </ i>
Hoo- hoo !
- Clementine !
<i> - There we go .
Whoo- hoo ! </ i>
Come on , man .
The water' s fine .
Nobody' s coming here tonight .
Believe me .
It' s dark .
So , uh , what' s your girlfriend' s name ?
Naomi , but we' re not really ...
I mean ...
We' re ...
Whatever .
<i>So this is great . </ i>
<i>Now I can look for , um, </ i> <i>candles , matches ... </ i> <i>and the liquor cabinet . </ i>
<i>Oh , God . </ i>
I think we should go .
There' s no phone line .
What ?
I think we should go .
<i>Why ? </ i>
It' s our house ... just for tonight .
We are " David and Ruth Laskin . "
Which one do you want to be ?
<i>Uh ... </ i>
I prefer to be Ruth , but I can be flexible .
What are you do ...
Alcohol !
Oh , boy .
So , are you okay with wine ?
I don' t know .
Well , you choose the wine .
I' m gonna go find the bedroom and slip into something more ...
Ruth .
I' m Ruth- less at the moment .
<i>I really should go . </ i>
I' ve gotta catch my ride .
<i>So go . </ i>
I did .
<i>I thought maybe you were a nut, </ i> <i>but you were exciting . </ i>
<i>I wish you' d stayed . </ i>
I wish I' d stayed too .
Now I wish I' d stayed .
I wish I' d done a lot of things .
Oh , God , I wish I had ...
I wish I' d stayed .
I do .
<i>Well , I came back downstairs, </ i> <i>and you were gone . </ i>
I walked out .
I walked out the door .
<i>Why ? </ i>
I don' t know .
I felt like a scared little kid .
I was like ...
It was above my head .
I don' t know .
<i>You were scared ? </ i>
Yeah .
Thought you knew that about me .
<i>I ran back to the bonfixire, </ i> <i>trying to outrun my humiliation , I think . </ i>
<i>Was it something I said ? </ i>
Yeah .
You said , " So go " ... with such disdain , you know ?
<i>Oh , I' m sorry . </ i>
It' s okay .
<i>Joely ? </ i>
What if you stayed this time ?
I walked out the door .
There' s no memory left .
Come back and make up a good- bye , at least .
Let' s pretend we had one .
Bye , Joel .
I love you .
Meet me in Montauk .
<i> I didn' t crash the plane . </ i>
<i>The plane crashed . </ i>
<i>I didn' t crash the plane . </ i>
<i> You were operating the plane</ i> <i>with the remote control, </ i> <i>and then it crashed . </ i>
<i>It was fucking windy . </ i>
<i>Come on , man . </ i>
<i>You' re stoned , and you' re driving . </ i>
<i>Yeah , the pot balances it out . </ i>
<i>The pot brings you back up . </ i>
<i>That' s why I smoke it . </ i>
<i>If I' m going to be drinking, </ i> <i>then I' il smoke it . </ i>
<i>It does . </ i>
<i>That' s a medical fact . </ i>
<i>It was proven</ i> <i>on the Science Network . </ i>
<i>Honey , just watch the road . </ i>
<i> I can' t see shit . </ i>
I saw you talking to somebody pretty .
<i>She was nice . </ i>
Yeah , man .
Who was that ?
She was , um , just a girl .
Okay .
So I gotta ...
I gotta drop the van off .
<i>Thanks , Stan .
Thanks . </ i>
We' il talk . <i></ i>
Hey !
Hey .
You got a lot of your stuff there , I see .
Yeah , that' s right .
My stuff .
<i>I take it you' re not coming back . </ i>
<i>I wouldn' t come back if I was you either . </ i>
Do you swear you didn' t know ?
I- I swear .
So you didn' t do the erasing ?
Of course not .
God , no .
And you never even suspected we were together ?
Once , maybe .
I was coming back from a job , and you were at his car .
I saw you two talking .
So I waved to you , and you giggled , you know .
How' d I look ?
You looked happy .
Happy with a secret .
And after that ?
I never saw you two together again like that , so I just ...
I don' t know .
I just figured I was imagining things .
Aah !
<i> Montauk train</ i> <i>now boarding on track " B. " All aboard . </ i>
I really like you , Mary Svevo .
You know that ?
Thanks .
Let me get my toothbrush .
Yeah .
Just ...
<i>Where are you , Clem ? </ i>
<i>I' m worried . </ i>
La- la- la- la- la .
<i>I feel like you' re mad at me, </ i> <i>and I don' t know what I did . </ i>
<i>What did I do ? </ i>
<i>I love you so much . </ i>
<i>I' il do anything</ i> <i>to make you happy . </ i>
<i>Tell me what you want me to do, </ i> <i>and I' il do it . </ i>
<i>Listen , I' m gonna stop by this morning</ i> <i>just to make sure you' re okay . </ i>
Oh .
Whew .
<i>Vámonos , señor . </ i>
I- I had a really nice time last night .
Nice ?
I had the best fucking night of my entire fucking life ...
last night .
That' s better .
This is weird .
<i> To all patients</ i> <i>of Dr. Howard Mierzwiak . </ i>
<i>My name is Mary Svevo . </ i>
" We' ve met , but you don' t remember me .
I worked for a company you hired to have part of your memory erased . "
<i>I have since decided</ i> <i>that this is a horrible ... </ i>
Some kind of teaser ad or something .
<i>In order to correct this, </ i> <i>I' m sending everyone' s fixile back to them . </ i>
<i>My name is Clementine Kruczynski . </ i>
<i>I' m here to erase Joel Barish . </ i>
What is this ?
I don' t know .
<i>He' s boring . </ i>
<i>Is that enough reason</ i> <i>to erase someone ? </ i>
<i>I' ve been thinking lately</ i> <i>how I was before and how I am now, </ i> <i>and it' s like he changed me . </ i>
<i>I feel like I' m always pissy now . </ i>
<i>I don' t like myself when I' m with him . </ i>
<i>I don' t like myself anymore . </ i>
<i>I can' t stand to even look at him . </ i>
<i>That pathetic , wimpy , apologetic smile . </ i>
<i> - That sort of wounded puppy shit</ i> <i>he does , you know ? </ i>
- What are you doing ?
I' m not doing anything .
<i>The bloom is certainly</ i> <i>fucking off the rose at this point . </ i>
- Are you screwing with me ?
- No !
- You are screwing with me .
- Joel , I' m not !
- You clearly are .
- Look , let' s just take a minute and ...
Patrick , get the fuck away .
Oh , sweetheart ...
Get the fuck away from me !
Can we talk about it ?
No !
Get the fuck away !
Joel Barish .
<i>Hey , Clementine . </ i>
Hey .
Nice to see you .
Yeah .
Yeah .
<i>Really very educated . </ i>
<i>I mean , she' s smart , I think, </ i> <i>but not educated . </ i>
<i>I couldn' t really talk to her</ i> <i>about books , you know ? </ i>
She' s more of a magazine- reading girl .
<i>Her vocabulary leaves</ i> <i>something to be desired . </ i>
<i>Sometimes ... </ i>
<i>I was embarrassed in public ... </ i>
<i>Hi . </ i>
<i>Because she would pronounce ... </ i>
<i>library " libary . " </ i>
<i>Hi . </ i>
<i>Libary .
Libary . </ i>
Look what I found .
<i> I think if there' s</ i> <i>a truly seductive quality</ i> <i>about Clementine, </ i> <i>it' s that her personality promises</ i> <i>to take you out of the mundane . </ i>
<i>You made me look skinny . </ i>
<i>Amazing , burning meteorite ... </ i> <i>will carry you to another world</ i> <i>where things are exciting . </ i>
<i>But what you quickly learn</ i> <i>is that ... </ i> <i>it' s really an elaborate ruse . </ i>
I' m sorry I yelled at you .
It' s okay .
<i>So flashy</ i> <i>in a kind of obvious way . </ i>
<i>But still , it seduces you . </ i>
Joel , I really like you .
I hate that I said mean things about you .
- Let me turn this off , okay ?
<i> - Hey , it' s ... it' s only fair . </ i>
<i>Where' s the real Clementine ? </ i>
<i>I mean , the whole thing with the hair ... </ i> <i>it' s all bullshit . </ i>
- I really like your hair .
- Thank you .
<i>I really like your hair . </ i>
Thank you .
I do .
<i>The world' s a goddamn mess . </ i>
<i>Is it some kind of a revolt ? </ i>
<i>Change your hair color . </ i>
You want a drink or something ?
Do you have any whiskey ?
<i>No , I don' t think her sex</ i> <i>is ... motivated . </ i>
<i>I saw it clearly</ i> <i>the last night we were together . </ i>
<i>It wasn' t sex . </ i>
<i>It was just sad . </ i>
Hey .
Sorry .
I thought there was more .
<i>The only way Clem thinks</ i> <i>she can get people to like her ... </ i> <i>is to fuck ' em ... </ i> <i>or at least dangle the possibility</ i> <i>of getting fucked in front of' em . </ i>
<i>And she' s so desperate</ i> <i>and insecure ... </ i> <i>that she' il , sooner or later, </ i> <i>go around fucking everybody . </ i>
I don' t do that .
<i>I wouldn' t think that</ i> <i>about you . </ i>
- Because I don' t .
- I know .
<i>Because it really hurts me</ i> <i>that you said that</ i> <i>because I don' t do that . </ i>
<i>I' m so sorry . </ i>
I' m sorry about all this .
I' m gonna ... go .
I' m a little confused .
I don' t really think I can be here .
Um ... bye .
Bye . <i></ i> <i>I thought I knew her so well . </ i>
It was nice meeting you and all .
<i>But I don' t know her at all . </ i>
<i>What a loss to spend</ i> <i>that much time with someone, </ i> <i>only to fixind out</ i> <i>that she' s a stranger . </ i>
Wait .
What ?
<i>I don' t know . </ i>
Just wait .
Just wait .
<i>What do you want , Joel ? </ i>
I don' t know .
I want you to wait for ... just a while .
<i>Okay . </ i>
Really ?
<i>I' m not a concept , Joel . </ i>
<i>I' m just a fucked- up girl who' s looking</ i> <i>for my own peace of mind . </ i>
- I' m not perfect .
- I can' t see anything that I don' t like about you .
Right now I can' t .
But you will .
But you will .
You know , you will think of things , and I' il get bored with you and feel trapped ... because that' s what happens with me .
Okay .
<i>Okay . </ i>
Okay .
<i>Okay . </ i>
<i>Change your heart</ i>
<i>Look around you</ i>
<i>Change your heart</ i>
<i>It will astound you</ i>
<i>Now , I need your lovin' </ i>
<i>Like the sunshine</ i>
<i>And everybody' s</ i> <i>gotta learn sometime</ i>
<i>Everybody' s gotta learn</ i> <i>sometime</ i>
