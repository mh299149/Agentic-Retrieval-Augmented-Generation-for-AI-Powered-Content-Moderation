- [,] Come on , they were at the same college at the same time .
Why are you encouraging this ?
It is a verifiable fact -- he was my roommate , he stole my ideas .
I am The Napster .
All right , all right .
What is the distance between the front door and the vault , Napster ?
It' s farther than you want to carry it .
Yeah , but , so , how do we get the gold from the vault to the getaway car ?
How wide is the hallway ...
Napster ?
Six feet .
Okay , you' ve got your gold .
Whoo !
We need more cars to handle the weight .
Looks like I' m going to need some help with the custom work , too .
I know a man for the job .
So I modified the camera to include the ... so we can create really hi- res digital maps .
Who' s that ?
Rob' s mechanic friend .
- Hey , Charlie .
- Hey .
Charlie , this is Wrench .
Hey , what' s up , man ?
Rob tells me you got real talent .
We need some body work done .
Need to pack up to 2, 700 pounds of cargo in these Minis with enough suspension and horsepower to outrun anything chasing us .
2, 700 pounds of what ?
Of whatever .
So , what do I get out of this mystery deal , man ?
1 0, 000 .
All right .
What comes around ...
Oh , hey , hey , hey , hey , hey .
We didn' t get a chance to meet yet .
Wrench .
Ham and cheese .
Oh .
Oh , that' s cold .
Damn , that' s cold .
Mmm .
What comes around
Just comes around
What comes around
What comes around ...
You want all greens ?
' Cause , ah , ' cause you got them .
What have you got ?
Welcome to L. A. ' s Automated Traffic Surveillance and Control Operations Center .
See , they use video feeds from intersections and specifically designed algorithms to predict traffic conditions , and thereby control traffic lights , so all I did was come up with my own kick- ass algorithm to sneak in , and now we own the place .
You want to do a dry run ?
I thought you' d never ask .
See , red light ?
Green light .
- Danielson ?
- Yeah ?
What' s up with Grid 34 ?
Let' s check it out .
Hey , hey .
Oh , oops , did I ... ?
Oops , wow , but it' s awesome .
Is that not awesome ?
- Can you change it back now ?
- Yeah .
Lights are working fine .
Just an accident .
That' s good .
What are those ?
Unnecessary engine parts .
I lost your smog controls , and 200 pounds of body fat .
You got yourself a sweet ride now , Charlie .
Put the pedal to the metal and I' m off
And never getting lost
Which way will I turn when roads cross ?
Press the petal to the metal , little more when it' s scary
But one thing for sure , keep my foot on the floor
Put the pedal to the metal and I' m off
And never getting lost
Which way will I turn when roads cross ?
Press the petal to the metal , little more when it' s scary
But one thing for sure , keep my foot on the floor
Won' t stop driving till it' s over
Still be cruising when the sun goes down
Won' t stop driving till it' s over
Put the pedal to the metal and I' m off
And never getting lost
Which way will I turn when roads cross ?
Press the petal to the metal , little more when it' s scary
But one thing for sure , keep my foot on the floor ...
You know what I' m thinking about right now ?
The look on Steve' s face .
You' re early .
I' m in a hurry .
Of course , you know that the Florida vote rigging was a ClA and mob operation .
Is that so ?
Yeah , which is not so very different from when your John F. Kennedy won a rigged election with the help of his father .
You' re uncomfortable that I mentioned it .
No , Yevhen , I don' t like making two trips .
You Americans .
You love your heroes .
A holiday for Columbus ?
He makes the wrong turn , and wipes out an entire indigenous people .
And you know what he was looking for ?
I bet you' re going to tell me .
Gold .
Supposedly for Queen lsabella , but don' t think that the Medicis back in ltaly didn' t want a part of that action .
And what did ltaly need gold for ?
For the long- distance slave trade based in Venice .
Venice ... that' s where these bricks ...
You were saying something ?
Nothing ...
No ...
No , you were really on a roll there .
Don' t stop .
I' m interested .
Please , I' m confused , my English --
You understand fine .
Now what do you know about my gold ?
No , I don' t --
Don' t you even think about lying to me .
Okay , okay , I , I heard a rumor about a heist in Venice .
35 million in bricks , with an imprint of a Balinese dancer on them .
- Who have you told ?
- No one .
Who have you told ?
No one !
I swear to God !
You swear to God ?
You crazy ?
I swear to God .
I didn' t !
Well , then I guess I believe you .
Yevhen ?
Yevhen ?
Let' s putt it this time ...
Putt , not drive .
Very good .
If you can just get it ,
I know you can , I know you can do it .
Much better .
I' m here to see Skinny Pete .
Yeah , he' s over there .
Thanks , man .
- Don' t stare .
- Huh ?
Don' t stare .
He doesn' t like when people stare at him .
Stare at what ?
That was good .
That was good .
Try that one , I know you' re going to get that one .
That was great .
- Skinny Pete .
- Yo , Charlie .
What' s up , man ?
How' s it going ?
So was I right about the gold bricks or what ?
Oh , I' m not here to talk about that .
We need , uh ... some supplies .
Baby , go relax .
Baby ...
Go relax .
Yo .
Yo .
Supplies .
What' s wrong ?
Huh ?
Uh ... um , some , uh , some nitromin , uh ... some , uh ... some nitromin , primer ...
- What' s wrong ?
- Huh ?
Yo .
Uh , nothing .
I' m- I' m cool .
I' m- I' m great .
Uh , I just need some , uh , big can of ...
Nitromin , primer ,
- detonating cord ...
- Right , right . ... two triple- charged chemical grenades and a launcher .
Right , like I had , uh , you know , told you ... earlier .
All right .
Cost you about five G' s .
Done .
Call me .
Thanks , man .
I' m sorry about that .
Uh- Uh , all right , man .
- Peace .
- Come on .
Get out .
There .
Vance has something to tell you .
Go on .
A couple weeks back ...
I was working counter at your cousin' s shop .
A guy come in asking about gold bricks with Balinese dancer on them .
What did you tell him ?
I told him that I' d seen some bricks .
I' m sorry .
What did this man look like ?
He had , uh ...
Iong black hair , big tattoo on his neck .
He must have weighed at least 400 pounds .
I know that guy .
Baby , go relax .
Do you know who I am ?
You' re Mashkov .
That' s right .
You were asking about gold bricks with a Balinese dancer on them .
Tell me why .
Steve just called to confirm his 8 : 00 reservation at the Water Grill .
Okay , let' s go over it one more time .
Gas the guards , doors open 8 : 15 .
Safe popped by 8 : 25 .
Loaded by 8 : 35 , out the door by 8 : 45 .
Straight to Union Station .
Only green lights on your route .
The rest of the city' s red .
Cops are stuck in the traffic , like everyone else .
Train leaves at 1 0 : 00 .
Cars have to be on the carrier by 9 : 30 .
Timing' s got to be dead on .
Let' s get ready .
Let' s get it .
Wow , that is a nice car .
Sorry , Rob .
Coast is clear , guys .
This is it , guys .
Moment of truth .
What the hell is this ?
Shit !
Steve' s neighbor' s throwing a party .
Are you here for the , uh , Baker party , sir ?
No .
We' re not blowing any gates tonight , guys .
Too many witnesses .
Stella .
I know , I know .
I' m late for my date .
Yeah , and you got to be charming .
You' il need him to ask you out again .
Sorry .
Let' s get out of the street .
I really can' t imagine you doing that .
What' s that supposed to mean ?
Well , you don' t really seem
Iike the adventurous type , you know ?
Don' t let the cable uniform , you know , throw you .
I wasn' t making assumptions .
I' ve made some assumptions about you .
Oh , really ?
And ?
Well ... you' re just going to have to wait and see .
Why wait ?
Let' s get a check .
Let' s go back to my place .
No assumptions ...
Not tonight .
It' s late .
I should go home .
What , you have a cable company curfew ?
No , but I' ve made some bad calls in the past .
Hey .
We should take this maybe a little slower , you know ?
This lovely dinner , sparkling conversation -- you still don' t trust me ?
Oh , I trust everyone .
It' s the devil inside them I don' t trust .
It' s an interesting saying .
It' s charming .
Where' d you pick that up ?
Can' t remember .
Really ?
I knew a guy who said it exactly like that .
Really ?
Yeah .
He' s the only person I' ve ever heard say that .
He said it all the time .
His name was John Bridger .
You' re hurting my wrist .
He had a daughter and she was about your age .
Let go of my wrist .
I knew that there was something familiar about you .
You' re exactly like your old man , you know that ?
I liked him , too , right from the start .
I liked him right up until the minute I shot him .
Who are you working with ?
She' s with us .
Gang' s all here .
You know , the only thing worse than a thief , Bendel ?
A coward .
Then you should have seen the way your daddy begged for his life .
It' s not worth it .
Put a leash on your cat .
Hi , Steve .
Charlie .
Not bad , Charlie .
Really , not bad .
You have no idea how hard it is for me not to reach across this table and kill you with my bare hands .
You know better than that , Charlie .
Can' t let emotion into these things .
Tell me it wasn' t about emotion when you shot John and left us all for dead .
That wasn' t about emotion .
It was about a lot of gold , and I wanted it .
Anything you think you deserved , you didn' t .
Hey , don' t talk about right and wrong with me , man ,
' cause I just don' t give a shit .
Okay ?
You got your cards , I got my cards , we made our play , and I came out on top , okay ?
Now if you want to start the game up again , that' s fine with me .
But what , I mean , what is your play here , really ?
I mean , come on , what do you ... what do you think ?
Y- you' il try to take out my guards , right ?
I have five of them that you don' t know about .
You' il try to have Lyle hack the system .
I' il change it again tomorrow morning .
What , what , what was y- your final move ?
I mean , you were going to have Bridger' s daughter come in and try to crack my safe ?
I mean , that' s ... that' s very poetic and all , but I just don' t see it .
I don' t think she' il get anywhere near it .
Same old Steve , huh ?
Always thinking defensively .
That' s why you' re always number two .
How do you figure that ?
You got no imagination .
Couldn' t even decide what to do with all that money .
You had to buy what everybody else wanted .
Oh ... well , try this on in your imagination , okay ?
That gold is already gone .
That' s bullshit , Steve .
No , really , it' s over Charlie .
I' m trying to move the last two bricks .
You want to come after me over a couple of lousy bricks ?
I mean , really , be my guest .
But you' re off to a bad start , you know ?
' Cause you just blew the best thing you had going for you .
You just blew the element of surprise .
Surprised ?
It' s over when I say it' s over .
Are you all right , sir ?
How you doing ?
Good ... considering ... considering the fact that I' m doing all of this for a man I barely knew .
You know what bothered me all those years , Charlie ?
It was that , whenever he' d call me to tell me that he was on some job ,
I knew you were right there with him .
You got to know him a lot better than I did .
Just ' cause he was around me more doesn' t mean he wasn' t thinking about you all the time .
Be nice if it was true .
It is true .
He always regretted not having been a good enough father to you , Stella .
How do you know that ?
Because he told me .
What did you do to your hand ?
I punched Steve .
Why do you get to punch him and I don' t ?
Those hands are way too valuable .
Hey .
Okay ?
There' il be nothing left of that if you keep rubbing it .
Tell Mr. Frazelli we' il see him at 8 : 00 .
Charlie !
He' s flying the coop .
When ?
His security guard called for a private helicopter at 4 : 00 PM .
There' s an armored car service coming to his house at 5 : 00 .
There is a cargo plane scheduled to depart LAX at 8 : 00 PM to Mexico City .
What if he' s moving the safe as a diversion ?
We crack it , it' s empty , the gold' s somewhere else .
Steve' s not about to let that gold out of his sight .
It' s going to be in that truck and he' s going to be watching it every step of the way from the helicopter .
So the gold' s headed to Mexico .
Who knows where ?
They could change the flight plan in midair .
Slow down , slow down .
You guys are looking at this the wrong way .
This is good news for us .
Charlie , what do you mean , " good news " ?
We' ve been trying to get to the gold in the safe , now the safe is coming to us .
We' re going to boost it in transit .
Charlie , it could take a dozen different routes to the airport .
We have no idea which one .
We can' t take out an armored truck during rush hour .
We' re already set up to do it .
Napster , gridlock every route except for the one we choose .
Force that truck to go exactly where we want it to go .
Where do we want it to go ?
We can' t have a shoot- out with armed guards .
We' d lose .
We do it like the ltalian job .
Hello ?
Why' d you do it ?
Do what ?
Yevhen .
You didn' t have to clip him .
Whoa , whoa .
What are you talking about ?
We didn' t clip anybody .
Yevhen' s cousin is under the distinct impression that you did .
Why does he think that ?
Because you want to know about the gold with the Balinese dancer .
You told him that ?
Listen to me , man .
If there' s one thing that I know is never to mess with Mother Nature , mother- in- laws or mother- freakin ' Ukrainians .
Look , I need a favor .
Yeah .
Had a hiccup last night .
Could use some help .
Want hands- on this time .
You interested ?
Could be .
But I don' t like to be kept in the dark .
If I' m in , I' m in .
Okay , you' re in .
All right .
What do you think , Charlie ?
This' il work .
Let' s go .
You' re amazing .
It' s a work of genius .
Uh- huh .
You okay ?
Just give me a moment .
Now ?
I' m about to insert this pin into this detonator tube , and if the brass touches the sides , we' il both be the last people we ever see .
Take all the time you need .
Hey , Charlie .
What ?
I love you , man .
I love you , too .
Okay .
Okay .
Your attention , please .
Metrolink train number 774 will arrive in approximately 15 minutes .
Check positions .
Napster ?
I' m in position .
Handsome Rob ?
We' re in position .
Everything' s quiet , Charlie .
Wrench ?
Set .
Charlie , we got an uninvited visitor .
Some motorcycle guard following the truck .
We' il deal with it .
Who are these cats ?
What' s wrong ?
Charlie , you won' t believe this .
He' s brought in three armored trucks .
It' s a shell game .
Shell game now .
Well , boss , I can' t reroute the truck if I don' t know which truck to reroute .
Just go with the one Steve follows in the helicopter .
Remember , he said he' d never let that gold out of his sight .
Unless he' s playing us , and he is .
Okay , let' s go !
Moving out !
Here we go .
They' re pulling out .
Napster , pull up the traffic cameras you' re watching .
Where' s the first camera the trucks go past ?
Vine and Yucca ; they' re all going to cross there .
See which one' s riding low .
First one is ...
First two are the same , so ...
Houston , we have our truck .
It is number 128 .
We' re moving out .
Three- kilo- bob to two- fox- mike , we' re heading to the airport .
Okay , guys , truck 128 has turned right heading west .
Gridlock time .
Mr. Scott , pick up a courtesy telephone please .
Mr. Scott , pick up a courtesy ...
We' ve crashed .
It' s not a crash .
We' ve got power .
I can' t log in .
They are about to hit a major detour and be sent your way .
Oops .
You' il ... never ... shut down ... the real ...
Napster .
What' s your problem ? !
Truck 128 , what is your progress ?
This is truck 128 .
Traffic' s out of control here .
We' ve got to look for another route .
Check the police band .
Okay , I' m opening up a space on Highland .
Oh , get us out of here .
I' m trying .
And he' s taking it .
Police scanners are saying computers are down at Traffic Control Center .
Nice , Charlie .
What are you up to ?
Go back .
I now command you to turn left .
Come on , take the left .
Yeah , you did .
You did .
Give us the flag .
Metro just passed through the station .
You are clear for 90 seconds .
Go .
Come on , Steve .
Whoa , whoa , whoa .
Look out !
Look out !
30 seconds and counting .
15 seconds , you' re either blocked in or you' re paint on the train .
Go , go , come on , come on !
Stay right on me , this is gonna be tight .
Go , go , go , go , go , go !
You' re gonna stop right there .
Okay , guys .
Coming into position .
Stay cool .
Ten ... nine ... eight ... seven ... six ... five ... four ...
Don' t lose ' em , don' t lose ' em ,
- don' t lose them . - three ... two ... one .
Damn .
Where' s my truck ?
What ... ?
What the fuck happened to my truck ? !
It just blew right through the street .
Well , get under there .
We have another problem , guys .
What ?
This isn' t the Worthington 1000 .
What ?
He switched safes on us .
Can you do it ?
It' s lsraeli made .
It' s got a glass re- lock system .
There' s a pane of glass right here behind this door .
And if I don' t drill perfectly through that hole , steel rods snap into place and you can' t open the safe .
And then we' re up shit creek .
I think I just cracked the glass .
I don' t think it broke though .
I can' t drill it again .
I have to do it by touch .
I can' t get through .
The train' s blocking the tunnel .
Where does the Metro rail come above ground ?
1 1th and Fig .
Positions two and three , meet at 1 1th and Figueroa and double back to Hollywood and Highland .
Hurry up !
Your attention please .
Baggage for train number 22 is now available at carousel number four .
Baggage for train number 22 is now available at carousel number four .
I can' t do this , Charlie .
Stella ...
I can' t do it -- I need a drill , a borescope , something .
- I need to ...
- You don' t need any of that .
Come on , Charlie .
Hey , you can do this .
Slide .
Come on , come on .
Hey .
Don' t you want to see what' s inside ?
Absolutely .
Napster .
Yeah ?
13 across , four high , four deep .
That' s , uh , 208 bricks .
How much ?
Oh .
Uh , 208 times ...
2 . 7 ... 2 . 7 million .
What ?
No , it' s 27 .
That' s 27 million .
That' s $27 million worth of gold .
Yeah !
Got the ... holy spirit .
You should get on it .
It' s a good train .
What did you think , John ?
27 million .
Say it again .
- 27 million .
- Say it again .
- Say it again !
- 27 million .
Say it again !
Two motorcycles on us , Charlie .
I' ve got three Minis in the storm drain heading east towards the L. A. River .
Stop them before they get to the street .
Shit !
Whoa !
Here we go .
Whoo !
Whoa !
Whoa !
Open your door .
Come on , guys , we' re moving .
There , there , there , there , there , there .
Hey , come on , come on , look out .
Come on !
Where you going ?
Where you going ?
I' m going to take Steve .
You guys go straight to Union Station .
I' il meet you there .
Stay on him .
Stay on him !
Okay , Charlie , I' m opening up a spot on lower Grand .
I know it' s you , Charlie .
Take your next left .
Nice move , Steve .
Get out !
- Get out !
- Okay .
I said get out !
They got a bunch of cars in there , right ?
Mini Coopers ?
Look , look , man ...
- I don' t know anything ...
- Hey , don' t worry about them .
I' il give you five grand you put me inside that car .
Buy your girlfriend something nice .
Come on .
Half now , half when you help me unload .
I' ve got to hand it to you , Steve .
You actually played this one pretty smart .
Decoy trucks ... you switched safes .
The helicopter routine ,
I mean , that was pretty damn good .
But now I' ve got the gold -- and you , you' ve got nothing .
I got this .
So cut the crap , and give me my goddamn gold !
Who the hell are you ?
I am Mashkov ... and you killed my cousin Yevhen .
Got to have some insurance , Steve .
Yevhen was already dead when I got there .
I' m sorry about that , but Yevhen dealt with a lot of unsavory people .
Now , this guy' s trying to play you .
You are right ... no imagination .
There' s a lot of gold in there .
We' re the only ones with guns .
I' il make you a good deal .
I' ve already made my deal .
What do you want ?
You know this was never about the gold .
Whatever helps you sleep at night , sweetheart .
Bitch !
Charlie !
Come on , Charlie !
Okay .
Wait a minute Wait a minute .
Wait a minute .
Wait a minute .
I' il double whatever he' s giving you .
Just don' t shoot me .
Don' t worry , I' m not going to shoot you .
No , I' m going to take you to my workplace .
I think you would be very interested in some of the machinery I use .
No , come on .
Guys .
I want to make a toast .
To John Bridger , the most brilliant master planner of all .
Father and friend .
To my dad .
Stella was right .
It wasn' t about the money .
Of course that didn' t stop the guys from having a little bit of fun .
Money !
Handsome Rob got his Aston Martin .
Get a good job with good pay ...
He took it for a ride to break it in .
Money , it' s a gas
Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash
He got off with a warning .
New car , caviar , four star daydream
Left Ear got his dream house in the south of Spain with a room just for his shoes .
Buenos dias .
Buenos dias .
Money , get back
Lyle finally made the cover of Wired Magazine .
I' m all right , Jack , keep your hands off of my stack
Are you really the Napster ?
Money !
Yes , I am .
And he got that kick- ass stereo he wanted .
Uh , would you listen to something for me ?
With speakers so loud they' d blow a woman' s clothes off .
I' m in the high- fidelity ...
If you would . ... first class traveling set
And I think I need a Lear jet
And me ?
I took John Bridger' s advice .
I found somebody I want to spend the rest of my life with and I' m gonna hold on to her forever .
Money !
It' s a crime
Share it fairly , but don' t take a slice of my pie
Money , so they say
Is the root of all evil today
But if you ask for a raise it' s no surprise
They' re giving none away
