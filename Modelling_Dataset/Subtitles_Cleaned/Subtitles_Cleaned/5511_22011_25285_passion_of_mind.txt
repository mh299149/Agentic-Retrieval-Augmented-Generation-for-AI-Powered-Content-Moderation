- [)] ( Woman ) This is me .
Or her .
That' s what we look like .
She' s different .
I' m different .
One day I realized I could no longer tell my dream world ... from my real world .
It felt to me that I was no longer one person ... but two .
( Doubled Voice ) I don' t know who I am anymore .
Hey , you actually got it .
( Speaking In French )
Hey , wait !
Wait !
( Girl ) Mommy , look . § Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens § § Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens § § Brown paper packages tied up with string § § These are a few of my favorite things §§
Oh , that was so great .
Okay .
Come here .
Ohh .
( Bell Tolling )
It was .
( Boy Speaking French )
- Mommy !
- No more stories .
Oh !
Mmm .
All right .
Covers , covers , covers , covers .
I' il read you more stories tomorrow .
All right , beautiful .
Night- night , Mama .
Don' t forget about me .
Not hardly .
Jen ?
- It' s time , honey .
- Mom .
Let' s go .
Good night, Jean- Pierre .
( Speaks In French )
To my angel for Mommy and my sister ... and Jean- Pierre and Micheline ... and all my friends from the village .
Even Daddy and Alex , who aren' t real .
( Chuckles )
And keep my daddy safe with you and love him .
Mommy ... c- could you lay in bed with me until I fall asleep ?
Sure , honey .
I' d love to .
Get your stuff out .
Let' s put your goodies away .

( Man On TV ) July has brought the onset ofstorm season ... as HurricaneJulie pounded the Eastern seaboard .
Hardest hit was the town of New Halifax on the coast of Maine .
Normally a quiet vacation community ... it is now an endless sea ofdebris , broken homes and broken dreams .
With winds in excess of 1 00 miles per hour ... the storm hammered boats and homes for hours .
( Phone Rings )
- ( Phone Beeps ) - Hello ?
Oh , hey .
No , I can' t bring you .
Because ex- boyfriends are very awkward for business ... and especially for the clients .
Yeah , even almost- exes .
Thursday , uh , I think I' m in Chicago .
But you know what ?
I don' t have my book in front of me .
If I had a sister I' d set you up with her , but you know ... that' s what you get for going out with an only child .
I' il call you later , okay ?
Okay .
- You' re late .
- Yes , I know .
Thankyou .
I' il do Throzen after Chicago , okay ?
( Muttering )
OnJonathan' s cover -- I think the design isn' t half bad .
I think the problem is in the color .
But I' il call McMillan .
That' s okay .
What' s this ?
Aaron Riley ?
Mr. Riley , it' s good to meet you .
We can get to the Mr. Riley stuff later .
Let' s start out as Aaron and Marty .
Please .
You' re here to ream me , Marty .
( Chuckles )
We both have full schedules .
Let' s get to it .
Well , I don' t usually interfere with a client' s business manager ... particularly one as new to the client as you are .
But I' ve been unusually irresponsible ?
Oh , no !
Not at all .
I mean , considering you' ve only known Ed ... six weeks ?
Four and a half .
- ( Chuckles ) - Lucy Schaefer lived with Ed ... for three years -- less , actually .
During which time she was doing the deed behind his back .
Hmm .
Not a nice lady .
Even he knows that now .
Marty , it' s his money .
But ifwe give her that much of it ... how is this poor girl ever going to start building some character ?
( Chuckles ) What do you think , I represent this woman ?
I never saw the bitch in my life .
We talked it through , Marty -- slow , careful and really complete .
It' s what he wants to do .
Mr. Riley ... don' t you believe in saving someone you care about from himself ?
( Chuckles ) No , ma' am , I sure don' t .
I' m not that smart .
Thanks .

( Growls ) What are you doing in here ?
- How did you get in here ?
- I stole the key fromJennifer .
She told me to .
( Exhales )
- Are you mad ?
- No !
No , baby , I' m not mad .
You didn' t wake me up .
But your sister' s gonna be in big trouble .
- Yea !
- ( Chuckles ) ( Making Whooshing Sounds )
- ( Laughing ) - ( Chuckles )
- No , no , no !
- Got you !
Look at her, Jessie .
( Grunting )
- ( Sobbing ) - God , she' s stubborn .
Why won' t she ask anybody for help ?
I wonder .
( Chuckles )
Help is on the way .
Go , go , go !
Whee !
- ( Grunting ) - You having a problem ?
No , Mom .
I' m fii ne .
- ( Chuckles ) - What' s funny ?
Nothing' s funny .
Nothing .
I --
I like when you try hard .
Especially at , uh , things you don' t thinkyou' re very good at .
- Mom , it' s not that .
- Okay , okay !
You know , sometimes when things come really easy to someone ... they think they have to be perfect at everything .
- But we' re not perfect , are we ?
- No .
Do you know anything that' s perfect ?
So why would you want to be no one and nothing ?
- Do you think that' s me ?
- Yeah , I do .
' Cause you' rejust like me .
( Girl ) Nanny , nanny , boo- boo !
You can' t catch me !
- ( Girl # 2 ) Yes I can !
- ( Sighs )
Ohh , ouch !
Damn it !
Twenty minutes now .
We' ve discussed the rain and the roses and the hot cakes .
Why do I feel you' re avoiding something ?
I' m so obvious .
God , I hate that .
Mmm .
How' s the dream ?
No , I said that awkwardly .
How is New York today ?
New York was , uh , fii ne .
I' m not your shrink , baby .
I' m just the old girl who comes and drinks your whisky ... plays in your garden .
I don' t want to see him, Jessie .
I don' t -- I don' t want to see any Dr. Langer .
We had a deal .
Ayear ago , we said ... ifthis was still going on , I wanted you to see someone .
We said ?
You said .
And he' s actually Viennese .
Isn' t that perfect ?
( Chuckles )
You' re not giving up on me , are you ?
No .
As long as you still want me here .
No , until you tell me good- bye , there' s hope .
And so , my good friend Jessica tells me ... ofan interesting case of multiple personality .
Martha ?
Marie ?
- ( Marie ) Here , it' s Marie .
- Marie .
When you fall asleep at night ... in that instant you fii nd yourself waking in another world .
In another life , where your name is ?
Marty .
Hmm .
And what do you call this situation ?
( Chuckles ) A full life .
( Chuckles ) My goodness , yes .
One is tempted to ask , could it be too full ?
I have a psychiatrist in New York .
He thinks that I' m a Manhattan career woman ... who dreams of being a mother in France .
See , that' s the problem with all ofyou guys .
You all thinkyou' re real , and I -- I don' t blame you .
( Chuckles ) Well , we can' t all be real , can we ?
That would be impossible .
One world is real , the other a dream .
Yes .
( Scoffs )
I know that .
But you do not know which .
Why is that , I wonder ?
( Sighs )
Because if I ... realized which ...
life wasn' t real , then --
Well , um , the dream wouldn' t work .
It ... wouldn' t give me the satisfaction ofthat life .
I suppose it wouldn' t .
( Chuckles ) Very ingenious ... but not without its dangers .
Do you realize how deliberate you make this sound ... as ifyou could turn it on and off ?
You' re riding two horses ... and the mind is not built to do that ... without breaking apart .
I don' t -- I don' t know ... how to get back to the way I used to be .
( Moaning Softly )
( Alarm Clock Beeping )
- ( Beeping Stops ) - ( Sighs )
( Man ) Viennese , no less .
YourJessie is really wheeling in the heavy artillery .
- Perfect , isn' t it ?
- So , what did , uh --
Dr. Peters , I really need to smoke today .
- You don' t need to smoke .
- Do you mind if I have a cigarette ?
- I could really usejust one .
- No .
- Ah , you' re so great .
- Marty .
Marty .
- Come on .
- Just one more puff .
Please .
- Marty .
- Okay .
It' s going out .
So , Dr. Freud told you what ?
You should realize , he says , that New York has to be the dream world .
I mean , who would fantasize ... being a house- bound mother and a widow at that ?
No romance .
That has to be real .
But New York -- ah .
Glamorous career .
Power .
Self- expression .
Endless line of men wanting to date you .
Every minute spent at your own whim .
- Now , ifthat' s not a dream , huh ?
- He said it with less drama .
So , you say to Dr. Freud ?
Please stop calling him that .
It' s Dr. Langer , and he' s as real as you are .
So , you told Dr. Langer what ?
My New York shrink ... thinks my life in Manhattan is hard work -- hostile , adversary work ... with long , grinding hours .
That yes , there are a lot of men ... but no real , uh , romance ... no one to love me .
And I' m alone , and who would dream that ?
What about the loneliness ?
Jessie said that ... a woman still grieving for her late husband ... isn' t ready to love anyone yet ... not even in their dreams .
( Chattering )
Okay .
I need to put you down so I can pay .
- ( Laughs ) - Goodness !
( Coins Clattering )
- Sarah ?
- ( Bell Rings )
Sarah ?
Sarah ?
Seraphine ?
Sarah ?
- Sarah ?
- ( Child Laughing )
- No , it isn' t .
- Why , sure it is .
We should go look foryour mommy .
She' il be worried .
Seraphine ?
I told you not to run off like that .
Oh , goodness .
You scared me .
- You know her ?
- My mommy .
- Oh .
- You know , where I come from ... people steal mommies who get lost in the market ... so you keep an eye on her .
- You like my hat ?
- Yes , honey , I do .
I like your hat very much .
But you should give it back now , okay ?
Oh , it' s clean .
I made it for her .
Well , then I guess you' ve got yourselfa new hat .
We better get going .
We' re going to be late .
Can he come with us to the park ?
Oh , I wish I could .
Bye- bye .
So long , lady .
Nice talking to you both .
- ( Sarah ) Bye !
- Bye .
- Go higher .
- Three more big pushes ... and then we' ve got to go getJennifer .
One , two ... three !
Okay , grab your stuff .
Then we' il get going .
Hey , you forgot yourjacket .
Hey .
( Man Chuckles ) ( Shouts )
I thought you weren' t coming to the park .
- I said I wish I could , so I did .
- Ah .
Always do what you wish you could .
( Chuckles )
Is that the secret of happiness ?
( Stammering ) No , it' s uh -- It' sjust what' s right .
Well , I wish we could stay , but --
Yeah .
Uh , I mean we have to go pick up Jennifer from school .
Let' s go .
- Thanks , honey .
- Another time , then .
- ( Sarah ) Bye .
- Bye .
Are you flirting ?
( Chuckles )
( Man ) Get off of me !
( Grunting )
Ohh !
- Ed !
- Oh , Marty , hey .
Jesus , is it 1 0 : 00 already ?
Listen , hang on just a sec , will ya ?
It' s 1 9- 1 2 .
You know Aaron Riley , don' t you ?

( Groans ) ( Groans )
Shit .
I' ve got your contracts .
Phyilis agreed .
Hey , listen .
Just give the manuscript to Phyilis , okay ?
I' ve decided to fii ght Lucy' s demands .
Yeah , well , you' ve got your friend Aaron to thank .
That game , those were the stakes .
- ( Ball Bouncing ) - ( Man ) Oh , that' s two .
( Players Chattering )
( Woman ) Marty , I have your call to Aaron Riley on line one .
- ( Phone Beeps ) - Hi .
Aaron ?
Hi .
This is Marty Talridge .
I just wanted to call and ... say thankyou ... for Ed' s manuscript .
- I didn' t do it foryou .
- You didn' t ?
But thanks for the thanks .
Anyway , how grateful are you ?
Well , how grateful am I supposed to be ?
Central Park , Sunday morning at 9 : 00 ...
Cherry Hill , across from the fountain .
Just take 30 minutes ofyour time .
Dress is informal .
I' il bring refreshments .
I' il think about it .
They' re lovely .
- Well , they' re not foryou .
- Ah .
Seraphine !
- Your boyfriend' s here .
- They' re not for her either .
Hi .
How are you ?
Look what I got foryou .
- Whoa .
What do you say ?
- Merci , monsieur .
You' ve gotta beJennifer .
- Okay .
Then these are yours .
- Go ahead .
Merci , monsieur .
- Ta da !
- And sweets too ?
- What are you up to ?
- Courting .
- Courting who ?
- Whoever .
- Bite .
- Merci , Guillaume .
Good .
Guillaume is William .
William what ?
Granther .
William Granther .
Hey, Jen ?
Why don' t you take your sister up ... and show Mr. Granther how you catch the Frisbee .
You guys are great .
Go on .
We' il watch from right here .
Point me in the direction ofthe kitchen ... and I' il put those in water .
- You still writing ?
- ( Chuckles ) Well , yeah .
Some of us never learn .
I' m down in Montaigne by the beach writing a new book .
Great .
Yeah , found out you were in the neighborhood .
That- That review .
- Yeah .
( Chuckles ) - Yeah , I still have it .
Well , not in my pants , but I have it .
( Chuckles )
The thing is , is , uh -- I didn' t like the book .
Oh .
Well , that explains the review .
Well , um , so much for cordial relationships .
Well , that depends on how things simmer ... for both of us .
- ( Sniffs ) Ahh .
- ( Chuckles )
- Gotta go back to Montaigne .
- Oh , sorry .
How did you know it was me ?
- The other day in the market .
- The butcher pointed you out .
And I realized you were the one who gave me that fantastic review .
- Figures .
- ( Engine Starts )
- You know what this guy really is ?
- What ?
He' s the chance to love again .
See , you' re starting to come out ofyour coma ... and it terrifiies you .
In New York , you sleep with men you don' t love and feel safe .
Now along comes William , you feel a pull ... and you react ... in your dream by creating this accountant .
- Aaron Riley ?
- Mm- hmm .
Oh , no .
You' re wrong .
He' s --
He' s no competition .
- This seat taken ?
- Hmm .
I don' t know .
I' m expecting quite a crowd .
But , uh , since you' re the fii rst .
Coffee ?
Thankyou .
When you think ofducks , what do you think of ?
Orange sauce .
You know , there' s something about two people ... sharing their souls on a Sunday morning thatjust --
You didn' t have to dress .
- I said dress was informal .
- Oh , yes .
I remember .
Well , here I am , driven by gratitude , up at dawn ... dressed informally .
- So , what' s up ?
- Nothing' s up .
We' rejust gonna hang out for 30 minutes .
- Why would we do that ?
- Because I' m interested .
Alarm ?
Mild alarm .
Uh- oh .
It' s even worse than you think .
- Oh yeah ?
- Oh , yeah .
- I' m not interested in dating you .
- You' re not .
I don' t enjoy rejection enough to wait in line for it .
And I' m not the kind of guy who attracts you .
And what kind of guy is that ?
Handsome , but with enough edge to make it a little dangerous .
Someone powerful who can sweep you offyour feet .
Who you can control ... only by leaving ... which is , ofcourse , the safest control ofall .
Ofcourse .
- My turn ?
- Sure .
- So , what are you interested in ?
- You .
Just who you are .
- It' s scary , huh ?
- Oh , yeah .
See , I can be dangerous too .
- So , what , you need a friend ?
- ( Scoffs )
Hey , don' t move for me .
No silly faces .
Okay , come on .
Please smile .
Oh , so pretty .
Oh !
That one was very good .
Come out , please .
- I don' t want to take a picture .
- You are making this so diffiicult .
- Now , be still .
Be st -- - ( Shutter Clicks )
( Chattering )
This seat taken ?
I' ve been waiting foryou since 9 : 00 .
The butcher said Fridays you have a sitter so you shop alone .
The woman assured me of regular habits .
God , it' s hell having a snoop for a butcher .
Um --
So , how are things ?
( Chuckles ) Things are fii ne .
( Chuckles )
- ( Chuckles ) - ( Laughing ) Oh , God .
I love talking small .
Saturday night .
A real date , okay ?
8 : 00 , dress up , everything .
Dress is formal .
My husband died a couple ofyears ago , and --
I haven' t had a real ... date .
Well , that' s great .
You' il be terrifiically uncomfortable ... because I plan to put the pressure on right away .
( Chuckles )
I' ve decided I want you to like me .
Hi there .
Table for one ?
Or were you expecting someone ?
Careful .
Wait here .
Okay , you can look .
- ( Laughing ) - ( Laughing )
- It' s beautiful .
( Chuckling ) - ( Chuckling )
Voila .
( Both Laughing )
- Do you know what that taste is ?
- No .
What- What is this ?
- Coriander .
Coriander and fennel .
- And fennel , huh ?
Uh- huh .
Well , there' s a trace -- a trace offennel .
Trace offennel .
Trace .
I can taste that trace .
What about the zinc ?
- Z- Zinc ?
( Laughs ) - ( Laughing )
What are you doing ?
Are you reviewing my food too ?
- No !
- Yes , you are !
I' m a saucier .
I spent two years learning to do sauces .
I see .
I' m sorry .
When you should have been learning to write ... you' ve been so busy learning your saucing .
Oh , see , when you should have been learning ... how to make someone bleed , you were .
Oh , ho , ho !
I' m just trying to make light of my own guilt .
That' s funny , because I' m just trying to use it .
- Lightly .
- Well , lightly , ofcourse , yeah .
I can' t believe I' m eating with you .
I just can' t believe I' m eating with you .
Not after that review .
But doesn' t it make it so exciting ?
You know , the book that I said I came down here to fii nish ... it' s actually done .
I just came down here to pick at it and ... and worry .
Worry' s good .
Worry' s very , very constructive .
- Y- Yeah .
- Yeah .
Yeah , but um -- ( Sighs )
- I want you to read it .
- ( Gasps )
- God , what an awful line .
- ( Both Laughing )
I want you to read it .
I want you to be crazy about it .
Ifyou could manage that without actually reading it ...
I' d do anything foryou .
- Is it good ?
- Well , no , not entirely ... but there are things in it that are -- are very good .
Christ , I just want you to read it .
And I want you to have this ... this look ... this , uh , this flushed look ... ifyou can imagine that .
And I want you to think ...
" What a guy . "
A guy who can ... can feel like that , I wonder how he' d --
- Make love ?
- Yeah .
And even more serious stuff .
I' d like to come home with you .
( Chuckles )
I' d like to say yes .
But I can' t .
Maybe another time .
It' s a deal .
So , usually Wednesday lunch .
What -- some guy who' s gorgeous , influential .
Rack of lamb , talk about ... power , sex ... fashion choices .
God , I miss it .
Why do you do this to yourself ?
Because I like you too much , and we both know it .
Well , it doesn' t mean we have to wear it .
But on you ... it looks good .
( Chuckles )
I have something foryou .
It' s a -- It' s not technically an heirloom , but ... it' s very precious to me .
No , no , no .
No .
You can' t open it till you' re all alone .
( Chuckles )
Oh , this guy .
( Jennifer ) Will you cook me a picnic too someday ?
Mommy says you cook .
Sure , I' il cookyou a peanut butter hamburger ... with raspberryjam .
Mommy would never eat that .
Oh , I' d make your mommy a chicken and tarragon sandwich .
- Yes , hold the fennel .
- Hold the fennel , hold the zinc .
So , what else did your mommy tell you about me ?
- She says you write stories .
- Uh- huh .
- Do you live in New York ?
- No .
Why New York ?
She knows a writer in New York ... and I want her to show him all her stories .
Her stories ?
Your mommy reviews other peoples ' stories in the New York Times .
- She doesn' t write her own stories .
- Counsel leading the witness .
- That' s overruled .
- She has her stories .
- In a box in a closet .
- Don' t you want to see them ?
- In a box ?
- How about this weather ?
Look at these cumulus clouds .
Boy , are theyjust something .
Are you sure there' s clouds up there ?
Because I don' t see any .
- Get real .
- How about what' s in the closet ?
In the box .
Gonna let me see them ?
Wish I could .
§§ ( Playing Tune )
It' s the wrong way around .
( Music Stops )
I hate to break up this beautiful romance ... but it' s time for bed .
Mom , it' s too early .
Oh , no .
I think it' s quite late .
- All right , you .
- Night- night , Mama .
Don' t forget about me .
Not hardly .
There' s something about your girls , about being with them .
I guess children make you a real person .
Do they ?
I think so .
They have to be real .
They see .
- Yeah .
- You okay ?
Yeah .
Sometimes I wish you didn' t look like you do .
Why ?
Because people who look like you have learned not to trust .
I can' t .
I can' t .
I' m sorry .
- I' m sorry .
- Don' t explain it .
While you feel like that , even if it' s forever , don' t fii ght it .
I want to make love to you .
I think about it all the time .
( Chuckles ) But in a way , in a real way ...
I' m afraid .
All my life , sex never really brought me closer to --
Usually it was the beginning ofthe end .
And I don' t want this to end .
This house , those children , your warmth .
Everything about you .
Don' t let me do anything to lose that , okay ?
- ( Chuckles ) - Now , walk me to my car .
Are you gonna come back in the morning and make me breakfast ?
Why ?
I' m going somewhere ?
Afraid the kids will see me ?
I could say that .
Or I could say it' s ... because of my husband .
But it' s something else .
Ifsomeone was to be with me ... and woke me up , something bad might happen .
It' s -- It' s very crazy , and ...
I can' t tell you about it .
Can I have that much mystery ?
( Sighs )
It' s okay .
It' s okay .
I' il leave .
( Kissing )
- ( Continues Kissing ) - Mmm .
Well , you -- I could maybe stay awake another hour or so .
( Both Chuckling )
Ifyou played your cards right ...
I could almost even make it three .
( Chuckling )
( Panting )
( Gasps )
Hello !
Um , hey .
Come on in .
Hi .
- Thanks a lot for coming over .
- Sure .
Um , would you like something to drink ?
- No , thanks .
- Coffee or anything ?
Water ?
- I' m fii ne .
- Okay .
Um --
You want to come on in and , uh --
You can sit over here .
Ifyou' d like , you can sit here or there .
Um --
- Good morning .
- Hi .
Um --
I don' t know why I , uh , why I really called .
Um --
I' m -- I' m , uh --
I' m sorry I' m like this .
I' m usually very strong and together .
I know .
But , um , something happened in France last night ... and I' m --
I' m just , uh --
I' m just not sure how I feel about it .
In France ?
I think I may have fallen in love with someone ... and I made love to him last night ... and I don' t even know if he' s real .
I' m sorry .
You , uh --
You slept with someone last night in France ?
Yeah .
Uh --
Ooh .
Um --
Aaron , you may think that I am ... absolutely , certifiiably insane .
And ifyou do , and you want to go ...
I' il completely understand .
I have a whole other life , in France .
And that' s not even the bad part .
The bad part is , um ... that both lives are so ... equal ... and so real to me that ... well , I don' t know which one is the dream and which one is real .
I don' t even know ifyou' re real .
Are you sitting there saying , " Shit .
How fast can I get to the door ? "
( Laughs ) Uh --
I- I' m real .
Well , you know , that' s what they all say .
I' m sorry .
It' s , uh --
I' ve been analyzed to death , and so ...
I was thinking maybe I could use a friend .
Well , you' ve got that .
( Sighs ) Wow .
What can I do ?
I don' t know ifthere' s anything you can do .
But I thought ... maybe ... if it was okay , you could stay with me today .
( Dialing Telephone )
Hey .
It' s me .
I' m gonna take the day off .
Uh --
Kiss their ass .
You can tell them the truth .
I don' t really care .
Yeah .
I' il see you tomorrow .
Okay .
Bye .
Thanks .
( Marty ) That' s , uh , her -- in France .
Or me .
It' s what we look like there .
( Aaron ) Well , she looks good in the earrings .
Her hair kind of -- ( Laughs )
Come on .
- ( Sighs ) - Let' s go .
- ( Aaron ) Hey , hey , hey , hey !
- I' m not cheating !
Just wait . Just wait .
Soon .
Soon .
- Ready ?
- Yes .
Here we go .
Here we go .
( Exclaims )
- It' s beautiful .
- Yeah .
It' s my favorite bridge ... in the world .
- How come ?
- It' s the prettiest .
The bridge , or my earrings ?
Both .
Next Wednesday is my birthday .
I' m funny about my birthday .
Going out would make me lonely , so I always stay in -- alone -- which is less lonely .
So , you busy Wednesday ?
I' ve got to go to Atlanta till the end ofthe week .
Some big doing .
How about when I get back ?
Sure .
Bejust as good .
( Peters ) You know , Marty , as to your romance with William ... it sounds like love when you talk about this guy .
I like that .
I can say , " Marie , you seem happy . "
I like that even better .
But ifyou' il forgive an intrusion from the real world for a moment ... why did you tell Aaron about your condition ?
I had to tell someone .
Maybe we could let Aaron be your analyst , and I' il do your taxes .
That was a very distancing thing to do .
Look , Marty , Aaron seems like a nice man .
You like him .
Maybe not romantically , but you seem close .
Ofcourse , telling someone you' re mad as a hatter ... doesn' t usually bring them any closer .
" Mad as a hatter " ?
It' s a medical term I like to use .
Listen .
Why don' t you keep William in your dreams and in this offiice ... and away from everybody else ?

Now , look , uh --
In the dream last night , exactly what did you tell Mr. Reilly ?
Well , uh , exactly ?
( Girl ) Aren' t you going to say good- bye ?
- ( Guillaume ) You all right now ?
- Everything .
Boy , poor Dr. Peters .
That must have rattled his teeth .
I would have thought you' d want me to be honest .
I do .
I do .
But I don' t want you scaring this William away .
You can bare your soul to Mr. Reilly ifyou like ... but not to William .
All he gets is your love .
And you know what that love is gonna do ?
Pretty soon there won' t be any dream to tell him about .
Just have a good time .
Come on !
Girls , Mommy' s off .
- Come here , honey .
- Pleasure meeting you .
- Pleasure was mine .
- I' il miss you so much .
- Good night .
- Hey !
I' il live , okay ?
Yeah .
I' m sorry .
One ofthese days we' ve got to work on the room thing .
- I promise .
- Okay .
- Good night .
- Night .
( Lock Clicks )
It' s a nice place .
Little pricey .
Well , ofcourse .
I have good taste .
When did you steal this ?
Last night .
So , tomorrow night , you gonna bring me back some foie gras ?
Oh , how cruelly you make sport ofthe insane .
( Laughing ) H- Hey !
I prefer " stone- cold nuts " myself , but that' sjust me .
Has more character .
Thankyou .

So what do you think ?
I mean , do you hate me ?
Do you think I' m nuts ?
- Do you -- - No , no , no .
- It' s worse .
I believe you .
- Worse ?
You tell me about this nightmare that you' re living through .
And all I can think of is this other guy .
( Laughs ) I' m jealous .
No , I' m crazed about a guy who doesn' t exist .
Well , he --
Never mind .
- ( Sighs ) - You really love him , huh ?
I think so .
So how close does he get to seeing who you really are ?
I don' t know , but --
But he ... calls my condition a passion of mind .
Well , he' s very wise .
I' m gonna fii ght foryou .
( Laughs )
Thankyou .
Was it good ?
It was good , wasn' t it ?
Hot .
Did you tell him about me ?
Poor guy .
How' s he gonna fii nd another girl like you ?

Ha- ha .
- Like it ?
- Oh , it' s great !
Once we get the curtains up ...
TV in ... we can put your friend here when he comes to visit .
My friend ?
Your friend .
The accountant from New York .
What' s his name -- Arnie something , huh ?
I can' t believe you are making fun ofthe handicapped .
" Handicapped " ?
He' s handicapped too ?
He' s handicapped and fiictitious ?
Pretty appealing .
Not him , doofus .
Me .
I' m the one who' s handicapped .
- I mean , I' m , you know -- - Mad as a hatter ?
Mad as a hatter .
Don' t you consider that a handicap ?
Yeah , that' s --
That' s a handicap .
- I don' t think it' s ever going off .
- Off ?
Yeah .
The light ... that always goes off inside me ... so I can move on .
Oh , God .
You know how to do that ?
Well , you commit beautifully ... and yet you still let me know ... that you could run , and ... damn you , that keeps me from running fii rst .
( Splashing )
When you think of kids ... what do you think of ?
Orange sauce .
I was aiming more at , uh , " How many ? " " When ? "
You mean , uh , with you ?
Yeah , me .
( Laughs )
Let' s see .
With you , I' d want a lot .
I' d want a lot with you .
You know ...
kids come fii rst .
I' d be real ruthless about that .
I' m talking about the way you are .
- Ah .
- Ah .
That .
Mmm .
What about France ?
You gonna have kids with him too ?
I don' t know .
Maybe he likes the ones I' ve got .
Am I so ... hypnotized ?
Could I commit my life to you just the way you are ?
Probably .
But I' d never do that to my kids .
Not in a million years .
And you have to hear that .
Couldn' t getJen to sleep .
She was in the weirdest ... mood .
She was wild .
Crawling under the ... bed and , uh --
I don' t know .
I couldn' t quite fii gure it out .
She wasjust in the weirdest mood .
Stories .
From a box in the closet .
Jennifer gave them to me after dinner .
She said they were beautiful , and I should read them .
It should be our secret .
I didn' t read them , ofcourse .
She' s very proud ofyou .
What she did taught me something ... about what your dream really is .
You said whatJen did taught you .
In your dream , Marty can do what she wants .
She can work with what she loves ... and give herselfto it , and it' s okay .
She doesn' t have to ... hide it ... in a box ... in a closet .
Every night I go back to a room ... and I lie there ... and I think about you .
When I dream , I dream about you .
- I know what you' re saying .
- No , you don' t .
- I do .
I do .
- The hell you do .
It' s all built around you .
Those people in New York -- they' re all you .
You' re analyzing yourself .
You' re courting yourself .
You' re making love to yourself .
It' s all my fault .
I' m sorry .
- I said more than that .
- I heard everything you said .
All of it -- and it' s right .
How long did he give you ?
He didn' t say .
Now .
You don' t have to lose the whole dream . Just the man .
Why do I have to lose anything at all ?
I don' t want to give up either ofthem .
You don' t have that choice .
You' re not playing alone anymore .
The real one will leave .
And when he does , you' il know the other one is the dream -- which means you' ve lost him too .
( Sighing )
This is your moment .
You' ve got to go for it .
I don' t know -- I don' t know if I can .
Yes , you can .
( William ) I can' t let you be safe anymore .
Choose .
Choose !
( Sighs )
What are you doing ?
Writing .
Oh .
- I should have guessed .
- I' m writing in here .
So , what did you dream last night ?
What does he look like ?
Is he dark ?
Strong ?
Pretty ?
Is he younger than me ?
Don' t do that .
Please don' t do that .
How does he make love to you ?
Where ?
How do his hands feel ?
His lips ?
Does he get to stay the night ?
Well , tonight he can .
What is it , uh , Sarah says ?
Don' t forget about me .
( Whimpering )
Oh --
( Bell Dings )
- Are you okay ?
- I' m okay .
There' s something I want to tell you .
Um --
You' re not going away with me this weekend .
Are you sure you' re okay ?
You look --
You look kind ofweird .
I am weird , remember ?
Oh .
Oh , yeah .
What are you looking for ?
I' m glad you' re here .
What are those ?
How many ofthose were you planning to take ?
Just one .
Why ?
You don' t want to sleep ?
- I don' t want to talk about it .
- Why not ?
- I just don' t .
- Why tonight ?
- What' s back there ?
- Nothing , nothing , nothing .
You can' t stay awake forever .
Jesus .
It' s one goddamn pill .
You know , you don' t have to go there tonight .
You could go someplace else .
Tahiti , maybe .
Maybe you could --
Maybe you could take me along .
' Cause I' ve never been there , and maybe we' d have a hell ofa time ... and you could -- you could tell me all about it over breakfast .
And maybe I want to be alone .
And I don' t want to be alone .
I don' t .
And I' m afraid not to be alone .
( Voice Breaking ) And I want you to stay .
Why ?
Why do you ever have to go back there again ?
Because my babies need me .
( Marty ) Look at this .
Wow !
What a sweetie .
- Thankyou .
- I' m really good , aren' t I ?
- You are good .
- Uh- huh .
What' s this ?
Where did you get this ?
Just looking around on the bookshelf ... for whatever -- snooping , basically .
I noticed that tin box on one ofthe shelves ... so I peeked inside .
- You found this here ?
- Yeah .
Right on the shelf .
You know last night , before I came in ?
I lay there , on that incredibly comfortable bed ... and I tried to hearyou breathing .
Couldn' t .
Started thinking about how close you were .
Figured I' d just come over to the bed .
I' d see you .
And you know , I was --
At fii rst I was afraid .
( Laughing ) Like , ifyou woke up , I' d disappear .
I actually thought that .
I really did .
Well , I guess it worked out .
You' re here .
Yeah .
Wherever that is .
These were , um ... my mother' s .
And , um , these are hers too .
She , uh , wore them together .
Nice pictures .
This is when I was fiive ... and this one' s when I was about ... ten , eleven , I think .
You haven' t changed much .
( Laughs )
I' m gonna be late .
I gotta go .
Why ?
Just thinking about my best friend .
She sounds pretty high maintenance .
I don' t know .
Could be quite a loser .
You might want to dump her .
No , she' s not a loser , just ... someone who needs to run when things aren' t perfect ... and love is never perfect , is it ?
And ifyou really care about someone ... really care , then you have to respect who they really are .
I know who you are .
You' re the little girl whose mama died in France ... when she was 1 1 .
One time you said --
You said , don' t I believe in saving someone ...
I care about from himself , and I said , " No , ma' am .
I sure don' t .
I' m not that smart . "
I would rather be your best friend than the guy ... that made you give up any part ofyourself .
I really would .
That' s what I aspire to be when I grow up -- your best friend .
So , ifyou need to run ... you should .
Mommy ?

Mommy ?

Mommy , what' s the matter ?

It' s okay .
It' s me .
It' s okay .
Why did you bring me back ?
I had to see you one more time .
I had to say good- bye .
- Oh , I love you .
- I know .
( Marty' s Voice ) Who knows what dreams are made of ?
The kiss ofa childhood friend ... the roar ofa stranger' s car on a gravel road ... the absolute calm of my father' s voice ... the warmth of my mother' s arms .
You' re not drinking tonight ?
No , I' m ... talking tonight .
Confessing , actually .
You go ahead .
I can keep a secret .
( Laughs )
Remember ... how you said you wouldn' t give up on me ?
Uh- huh .
You won' t , will you ?
Promise me you won' t , ' cause I couldn' t do it without you .
So I guess my big secret ... is that I love you like crazy , Mom ... and I always will ...
even if I can' t ... be with you like this anymore .
I' ve always been there -- even when you didn' t know it .
Thankyou for coming .
Well , I fii gured there' d be a drink waiting .
Well , I couldn' t let you down .
I meant always .
Thankyou .
Me too .
Don' t forget about me .
Not hardly .
Mommy .
I had a bad dream .
( Marty ) Goodness , you guys .
Lay back , sweetie , and just relax .
Can you rub my foot ?
Yes , I can rub your foot .
- Better ?
- It was scary .
You know , there' s something that I want to talk to you about .
Something very , very important .
Something ... foryou guys to remember ... and to know ... even when I' m not with you ... whereveryou might be .
What do you mean ?
You see , we' re the same person --
all of us -- and I love you ... with all my heart -- all of it .
Always , always , always .
And when ... you think of me , you ...
think then I will be there .
We' il all be there together .
I -- I love you , Mommy .
I love you too .
And whereveryou are ... just think of me , and I' il be there for you too .
Thankyou , sweetie .
- Love you , Mommy .
- I love you , sweetie .
- Can you rub my foot too ?
- Yes , I can rub your foot too .
- I love you , Mommy .
- Love you , Mom .
( Footsteps )
( Aaron ) Is this seat taken ?
I brought you something -- stories from a box in a closet .
I brought them home from France .
I won' t be going back there .
I -- I would like you to read them .
I' d like you to have them .
They were always meant foryou .
