"Maria is a complicated character. She illegally transports drugs (while pregnant). But she's also caught in a difficult world, and in the end finds her inner strength.
",,"Graphically bloody scene depicting aftermath of drug-transporting accident.
","Mild teenage foreplay, sexual discussions regarding pregnancy.
",,,"Teen drinking, drinking while pregnant, humans used as vessels for transportation of drug pellets.
","Parents need to know that this movie is about an unfortunate chain of events that leads a 17-year old Colombian girl, Maria (Catalina Sandino Moreno), to smuggle drugs into the U.S. by swallowing them. The processes of preparing the drugs for swallowing, the actual swallowing, and the retrieval are shown in exhaustive detail. Though only one brief heavy kissing scene takes place, much of the plot revolves around Maria's pregnancy and the pressures it brings, which are discussed extensively. Language (English subtitles) is casual and conversational, but often heated and uncensored. While Maria is noble in many regards, her actions are dangerous, and they put her life in jeopardy.

"The message here seems to be that people are so stupid that they'll fall for anything. Women are shallow, empty-headed, and self-involved; Men are only slightly better. Even the most ridiculous plan can unwittingly succeed if the motivation is pure. One flimsy attempt is made to teach a woman to stand up for herself when a man manipulates her.
","Conceived as a parody, the filmmakers have taken stereotyping to new heights. With the exception of one journalist, who is only mildly ignorant, the women are portrayed as overwrought, jealous, sexually manipulated, incredibly stupid victims. A male athlete is depicted as arrogant, ignorant, aggressive, and a sexual predator. The FBI agents are all buffoons. The two heroes have admirable motives, but very limited brain power.
","Cartoon-style violence with no injuries or deaths: fist fights, two shoot-outs with guns, a dog in danger as it dangles from a car window, a dog attack, and a final brawl.
","No actual sexual activity, but frequent sexual innuendo, gross language, sexy dancing and leering, raunchy attempts at humor (licking, sniffing panties, and more). Women and girls appear in tight, clingy, sexually revealing attire throughout. Numerous shots of plastic body parts, including breasts, and one extended scene devoted to a group of women experimenting with a rubber penis.
","In the Unrated version, no coarse or vulgar expressions are left out and the sheer quantity of sexual references is daunting. Some examples: ""bitch fit,"" ""ass,"" ""balls"" ""coke whore,"" ""vagina,"" ""booty call,"" ""s--t,"" ""go down on,"" ""genital herpes,"" and many, many more. Racial slurs, including the ""N"" word appear often. Farts are used as plot devices in many scenes and range from uncouth to overwhelming.
","Louis Vuitton luggage, Midol, Perrier, Kool-Aid; a convenience store features M &amp; M's, Nestea.
","People drink at a party, in a club. Two men are shown drowning their sorrows with beer. A pill for sexual arousal is used to move the plot.
","Parents need to know that the parent advisories here refer to the more readily available unrated version and not the PG-13 movie seen in theaters. Because the central plot involves two African-American men disguised as white women there is much racial humor attempted, including innuendo, ""black versus white"" stereotyping, and slurs. Coarse, raunchy language is continuous, including numerous references to male and female genitalia, breasts, sexual promiscuity, and sexual acts. The women are vapid sexual objects throughout. They dress, dance, and behave in a provocative manner. Farts account for many of the plot turns and much of the hoped-for comedy in the movie.

There is fighting and gunplay. Characters are shot, and one is killed. The main characters are jewel thieves and the story includes lying and betrayal. The movie is oddly homophobic, with humor built on misinterpreted situations. A strength of the movie is positive portrayals of female and minority characters and inter-racial relationships.

"No positive messages. The film's title is in reference to one of the character's views of the criminal world and life in general. To paraphrase: The layers of the cake are excrement that one endures in life until they are at the top of the cake and forget what excrement smells like.
","No positive role models. The lead character is a cocaine dealer. The movie is centered on various players in the drug trade.
","Character shoots himself in the head. Man shot in the head and killed at point-blank range. One of the characters brutally beats up another character, pounding him until he's a bloody pulp, and then pouring the contents of a boiling hot tea kettle on his skin. A man is found dead with an iron burned into his chest. Innocent man shot and killed in a warehouse. Explosions. Character found dead from a drug overdose.
","Characters have sex, no nudity. Man shown watching a pornographic movie; sounds of moaning.
","Constant profanity. ""F--k"" used on a regular basis. In a fantasy sequence, a high-end boutique sells drugs, and the name of the brand is ""F--K"" with the two middle letters switched. ""S--te."" ""Piss,"" ""bastard."" Various racist terms used to describe black, Asian, and Pakistani people.
",,"Movie's lead character is a cocaine dealer. One of the plots centers on a large shipment of Ecstasy stolen from a brutal Serbian kingpin. Cocaine use shown. References to hashish and LSD. Cigar and cigarette smoking. Champagne drinking.
","Parents need to know that Layer Cake is a 2004 British action-crime movie in which Daniel Craig plays a cocaine distributor caught in a web of deceit involving kidnapping and stolen drugs. There's considerable drug use, including cocaine, and a central part of the plot is a stolen shipment of Ecstasy pills. Constant profanity, including ""f--k"" frequently used, as well as racial slurs for Pakistanis and people of color. The title of the movie is a reference to one of the character's philosophy of life, in which most people are born in ""s--t"" and try to climb out of these layers until they no longer smell it. There's violence throughout, including a scene in which a man beats another man to a bloody pulp in a diner, then finishes the job by pouring the contents of a boiling hot tea kettle on his face. Character shoots himself in the head. Characters killed by machine gun fire. Man found dead of a drug overdose. Characters shown having sex in one scene (no nudity), and sounds of people having sex as a character is shown watching a pornographic movie. This movie is directed by Matthew Vaughn, who also directed Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch, and the gritty noir fast-paced style of Layer Cake is in a similar vein. Based on a novel by JJ Connolly. To stay in the loop on more movies like this, you can sign up for weekly Family Movie Night emails.",Layer Cake  ,

"Among the violence and gore, there are messages such as: appreciate life, the wrongs of the past will catch up with you, and knowledge is power. However, it's also OK to use any means necessary -- however violent -- to make your point.
","Adam makes a living invading people's privacy without showing any concern about ethics. He's suspicious at first for his own protection but gradually understands that the only way to survive may be to trust others and work together. Lawrence is smart, observant, and tenacious, refusing to take the option of killing Adam as his way to survive. Even though he cheats on his wife, he shows love and dedication to her and their daughter during the movie.
","Much of the film takes place in a room with two kidnapped characters who are chained up, as a body with a bullet wound to the head lies in a pool of blood on the floor. Characters (including a child) are bound, gagged, and threatened with a gun. Flashbacks include dead bodies caught in razor wire, with pieces cut out and burned to death. A character is strapped to a chair with a bear trap-like contraption on her head, and another is temporarily paralyzed and stabbed repeatedly, his intestines pulled out. A throat gets slashed, and characters are shot -- one fatally. A character saws through their own ankle, though mostly off-screen with little injury detail shown. There's physical fighting, and a character is beaten to death with part of a toilet -- again, mostly off-screen, but with bloody wounds shown. Mentions of suicide and a passing reference to pedophilia.
","References to an affair, sexual innuendo, male nudity in a flashback involving a dead body caught in a trap -- though low lighting makes the full nudity implied rather than shown.
","Frequent strong language throughout includes ""f--k,"" ""f---ing,"" ""motherf----r,"" ""s--t,"" ""holy s--t,"" ""bulls--t,"" ""bastard,"" ""a--hole,"" ""son of a bitch,"" ""crap,"" ""Jesus Christ"" (as exclamation), ""pr--k,"" ""hell,"" and ""damn.""
",,"Passing mention of drug addiction. A character smokes a cigarette. Colleagues suggest getting a beer, though they don't end up going.
","Parents need to know that Saw is a horror film about two men locked in a room, one of whom is tasked with killing the other in order to save his family. It's extremely violent, with shooting, physical fighting, and gore (such as intestines being pulled out), as well as death and dead bodies shown on-screen. At one point, a child is kidnapped and threatened with a gun. Some of these moments of violence and gore are fleeting, taking place off-screen or portrayed via characters' reactions. Language is very strong, with frequent use of ""f--k"" and ""s--t."" While there's ethnic diversity within the cast, the main characters are all men -- one is a prominent Black detective, but the first character to die on-screen in real time is a character of Chinese heritage. There are moments of humor and an interesting element to the setup: The criminal, Jigsaw, plays a game with the victims based on mistakes from their past and intends to make them grateful for being alive. Popular with horror fans, the film has inspired a long-running franchise.

His partner, Detective Sing, is played by Ken Leung, an actor of Chinese heritage. Both believe in justice and have each other's backs. But Detective Sing is the first character to die in real time on-screen. Director James Wan is Australian of Malaysian Chinese heritage. The two main characters are White men: Lawrence (Cary Elwes) and Adam (Leigh Whannell). There's a Black female police officer in a minor role; White women include Lawrence's wife, who isn't developed, and Amanda, who plays a traumatized survivor. (Later in the franchise, she develops a more empowered role.)

"The ""elephant"" of the title refers to the idiom ""the elephant in the room"" that everyone ignores. The movie gives the sense that problems exist with teens and high schools, and that grown-ups are simply not present. Adults very rarely appear in this movie, and when they do, they are usually either part of the problem, or totally unaware of what's going on around them. However, aside from pointing this out, the movie doesn't offer any proactive suggestions.
","Teens in this movie are basically miserable and are trying their very best to muddle through with little or no help, and this is before the unspeakable horrors that are about to make their lives much worse. These characters are generally unable to ask for help or to speak to others about their problems.
","Two teens arrive at a high school with duffel bags full of guns. They begin shooting teens and teachers arbitrarily. There are dead bodies and lots of blood. As these teens prepare for their big day, they play violent shooting video games, browse the Internet for guns, and watch a documentary about Hitler. There's a scene of teens bullying another teen in a classroom (throwing wet, wadded-up paper at him).
","Two teen boy shower together and kiss (they are shown through the shower door, waist-up). A teen girl's naked bottom is quickly glimpsed in a locker room shower scene. Other boy-girl teen couples are shown briefly kissing. Two romantic teens, having their photo taken, make reference to ""naked pictures.""
","Most of the language comes during the horrifying final stretch, with upwards of a dozen uses of ""f--k"" and ""s--t."" Other words include ""bitch,"" ""hell,"" ""retarded"" and ""oh my God."" Some name calling: ""loser.""
","Capri Sun is mentioned and seen.
","A character's father is presumed to be an alcoholic, and drives his son to school drunk. The car swerves all over the road, bumps into obstacles, and gets scratched, but no one is harmed. In a very brief scene, two (adult) cafeteria cooks sneak off to smoke pot in a storage room.
","Parents need to know that Elephant is Gus Van Sant's Palme d'Or-winning drama, which is loosely based on the infamous 1999 Columbine high school shootings. It's deliberately mysterious and opaque, following several characters throughout the day and observing that they are all dealing with personal troubles, with little or no adult help. It contains some shocking violence, namely two teen boys shooting and killing people at school (with blood shown). Language is strong, but mainly during the final stretch, with several uses of ""f--k"" and ""s--t."" Teen couples are shown kissing, and two boys are shown showering and kissing (though seen only above the waist). There's also a very brief glimpse of a naked bottom in a girls' locker room. A teen's father is shown to have a drinking problem, and there's a brief scene of cafeteria workers smoking pot. Though rated R, parents might consider the movie as a discussion-starter for mature high school teens.

"Even in the darkest times, hope can still be found. But the film sends a barrage of bleak messages to get there: Your family and loved ones can die at any moment. One mistake can have consequences that haunt you for life. And cheating is OK if you're in a loveless relationship.
","Reckless behavior all around, though characters are humanized: Cristina -- who's in grief -- does drugs, tries to drive while high, etc. Jack tries his best to become a better person through religion, but his mistakes still have fatal consequences, and he physically/verbally abuses his children. Paul cheats on his wife. Characters have unsafe sex.
","Characters shoot guns and get shot. An unconscious character lies in a pool of blood as a woman holds him, crying out for help. Two apparent suicide attempts -- one is bloody/gory. Hospital scenes include a main character who's intubated and hooked up to IVs, visible surgery scars, discussions of heart failure and death, etc. A character dies peacefully on-screen. A parent slaps his kids and yells at them. A parent and his children die in a car accident (off-screen, but police cars surround the scene, and a child's shoe is visible); the mom sobs when she hears the news. Scenes of grieving as a mom throws away children's bikes, struggles to enter their old room, etc.
","Characters have sex (bare breasts and thrusting visible), kiss, grope, and lie naked in bed together the morning after (bare backs, breasts, and a rear end are visible). Brief scene of an explicit pornographic film plays at a fertility clinic. Discussions of fertility complications, a past abortion, and getting pregnant.
","Several uses of ""f--k"" and ""s--t."" Characters also say ""bulls--t,"" ""bastard,"" and ""pr--k."" A disabled man says someone ""made [him] feel like a cripple."" A character jokingly flips their middle finger.
","Coke and Diet Coke are visible and mentioned a few times. Characters use Dawn dish detergent.
","Main characters frequently smoke cigarettes. They also drink alcohol, snort cocaine, and take pills on-screen. A drunk driving incident kills three people (not depicted, but it's a key plot point).
","Parents need to know that 21 Grams is the second film in writer Guillermo Arriaga and director Alejandro González Iñárritu's ""Death Trilogy"" (the others are Amores Perros and Babel). Violence includes on-screen suicide attempts, an unconscious character lying in a pool of blood as a woman cries out for help, and hospital scenes with sick characters. A parent and his children die in a car accident (off-screen); the mom sobs when she hears the news. A parent slaps their kids and verbally abuses them. Language includes several uses of ""f--k"" and ""s--t,"" plus ""bastard"" and ""pr--k."" Explicit sex scenes show naked breasts, a rear end, and thrusting, and there's a brief glimpse of a pornographic film. Characters frequently smoke cigarettes. They also drink, snort cocaine, and take pills, and a drunk driving incident is a key plot point in the film. Though the film's on-screen content is almost entirely bleak, it does eventually conclude that hope can be found even in the darkest times.

On-screen, the three main characters include Cristina Peck (played by Naomi Watts, who's White); Paul Rivers, who has disabilities due to his heart condition (Sean Penn, White); and Jack Jordan (Benicio Del Toro, multiracial Latino including Puerto Rican, but the role is White-passing). Other than Cristina, women have flat characterizations, such as being obsessed with getting pregnant, etc. Brief stereotypes: Black teens play basketball in juvenile detention and get into a fight, there's a Latino gardener, and disabilities are portrayed as terminal and/or unwanted (one person uses the term ""I am a f---ing amputee"" to describe how it feels to have their family die).
