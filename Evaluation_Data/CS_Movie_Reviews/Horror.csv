"<div>Teamwork rules the day in this movie. Whenever characters don't cooperate, or think mainly of themselves, they end up as beastie chow. Characters that work together, for the most part, manage to beat the odds. (There are exceptions, however, even to this rule.)
</div>","<div>The movie features very strong sci-fi violence, creature attacks, and gore. Several characters die, including main characters. There's a huge spaceship crash. We see splatters of blood. Characters are shot, stabbed, and slashed. Characters fight and argue with one another.

Characters begin by not trusting him, but eventually look up to him and depend on him for survival. He's not particularly nice, but he's resourceful and confident.
