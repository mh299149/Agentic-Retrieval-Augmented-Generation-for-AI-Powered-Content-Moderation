","Parents need to know that this movie is partly kooky and partly philosophical, and not always accessible to younger kids. While the slapstick (pratfalls, face slaps) and puns can be amusing, the chatter alternates between clever and tedious. Characters drink beer and use mild language. Parents should also know that the movie has some scary, if abstract moments (the earth is destroyed from outer space; the image features no people, but the globe does go pffft), some shooting of science-fiction-ish weapons, a few odd, large, ugly creatures.

One girl blows up into a giant blueberry, another boy is sucked into a tube, the other girl is attacked and pinned down by squirrels who proceed to throw her down a garbage chute. In one early scene, dolls burn up and their eyeballs pop out. The movie is much closer in dark tone to the book than its cinematic predecessor. Willy Wonka himself seems to disdain families.

"In the ongoing story about good and evil, Harry learns important life lessons in the wake of tragedy. Honesty and integrity are repeatedly at stake. Friendship, love, bravery, and loyalty are always major themes in the series, as is the idea of making good choices.
","Two deaths, including one very stirring death of a teen. No blood is shown, but lifeless bodies are.

","Parents need to know that Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is the first PG-13 movie in the Harry Potter series (all based on the books by J.K. Rowling), and not for nothing. The fourth installment has two deaths (including a really sad one), scary creatures, some romantic yearnings, and edge-of-the-seat scenes. With each film, the scariness quotient increases. This movie features fighting dragons, tortured bugs, a huge booby-trapped maze, and an underwater horror show. Young kids who don't understand the difference between fantasy and reality should stay clear. So should kids going through an anxious time about unnamed terrors or unwanted separations, as one of the death scenes may be extra upsetting. The action is sometimes rowdy, and camera movements/edits are aggressive, all of which increase the scary effects. Romantic tensions ramp up in this installment.
