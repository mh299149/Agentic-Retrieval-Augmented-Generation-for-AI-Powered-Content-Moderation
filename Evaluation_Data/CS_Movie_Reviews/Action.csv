","Parents need to know that The Last Samurai is a historical war drama starring Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe that's set during Japan's Meiji Restoration era in the late 1800s. Expect intense battle scenes with sword fighting, shooting, cannon fire, and explosions. The main character has war flashbacks to invading and gunning down a Native American settlement, including shooting children (screaming, blood splatters). Several sympathetic characters are killed on-screen, including by seppuku (a suicide ritual). Characters drink to inebriation and sometimes smoke. They also say ""s--t,"" ""damn,"" ""ass,"" and ""son of a bitch,"" while White characters say ""red man"" and ""savage"" to describe Native Americans, plus use the terms ""Jappos"" and ""Orientals."" There's a bit of romantic tension that includes lingering looks and a near kiss. Though the film falls into the White savior narrative, main character Algren (Cruise) does demonstrate curiosity about other cultures and has humility when interacting with them, as does samurai leader Katsumoto (Watanabe). The film also has a majority Asian cast. But it uses the historical genocide of Native Americans to further a White character's narrative, and the only female character of note is clichéd as a love interest who nurses the main character back to health. To stay in the loop on more movies like this, you can sign up for weekly Family Movie Night emails.",The Last Samurai  ,"It's better to approach people with curiosity and humility than arrogance, even when dealing with enemies. But the film simplifies/glorifies bushido, the samurai way of life, while modernity (guns, railroads, capitalism) is portrayed as a loss of innocence. These flat depictions portray Japanese samurai as clich<meta charset=""utf-8"" />éd ""noble savages"" who are innocent but wise.
","Algren committed wartime atrocities that still haunt him. When he's ordered to put down another rebellion, he finds himself siding with the rebels -- the samurai -- showing curiosity and humility as he learns about their culture. Several samurai are positively portrayed, if two-dimensional and martyred: Katsumoto has deep wisdom and radical compassion, Nobutada is kind and joyful, Taka is the perfect caregiver, etc. Many greedy characters also exist, such as Mr. Omura, who will gladly see the samurai murdered so that he can build his railroad, and the racist Colonel Bagley.
","Story centers on White character in a movie about samurai and the Meiji Restoration, easily falling into White savior narrative, but it does have a majority Asian cast and stars veteran Japanese actors Ken Watanabe and Hiroyuki Sanada. It's also one of the few American films to explore this time in history -- Japan's 19th century efforts to modernize -- and it does so with curiosity and a deep respect for bushido (the samurai way of life). Algren's behavior in a remote samurai village is positive, as he stays humble, learns Japanese, and defers to locals. But the film's respect for bushido slips into glorification, arguably fetishization, as samurai fall into ""noble savage"" stereotypes: innocent but wise and uncorrupted by modern civilization. Also uses the historical genocide of Native Americans to further a White character's narrative, painting Algren as a ""good guy"" for feeling tortured about taking part in a massacre. The only female character of note is Taka, who's clich<meta charset=""utf-8"" />éd as the main love interest who nurses Algren back to health. The film has racist language, mainly used to depict White characters as villains as they call Native Americans ""the red man"" and ""savage."" But neutrally portrayed White characters also use words like ""Jappos"" and ""Orientals.""
