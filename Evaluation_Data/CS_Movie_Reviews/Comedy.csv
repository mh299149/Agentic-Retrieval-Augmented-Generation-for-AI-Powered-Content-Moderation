"Despite vast cultural differences between people, understanding and respect for differences can lead to satisfying, close friendships. Though taken to extremes in this film, love, warmth, and openness lead to stable, long-lasting relationships.
","On the plus side: good parenting is a primary goal of each of the film's main characters. Some gender roles are turned upside down: a leading male character is a nurse; a bright, vibrant lawyer finds his true calling as a parent and househusband who is supported by his psychologist wife. On the negative side, there's lots of stereotyping that is meant to be over-the-top and funny: Jewish people, a Latina housekeeper (beloved, but played as a broad caricature), uptight ""WASP"" behavior, law enforcement seen as either harsh and rigid or inept and buffoon-like.
","There are a number of minor pratfalls and accidents, all intended to be funny. Some examples: a dog is flushed down the toilet (and saved within moments); a backyard football game leads to a back injury (the character recovers quickly); a member of the Focker clan is injected with sodium pentathol; a character is attacked with a stun gun and has a brief ""funny"" seizure. In the background of one scene, a clip of a violent moment in the film <i>Scarface</i> appears on a television screen.
","There is no overt sexual activity, but much of the film's humor is based on sex. Beginning with frequent wordplay on the ""Focker"" name, this film is filled with sexual innuendo, sexual references, humor at the expense of the characters' sexuality, as well as discussion of sexual acts, and bodily functions. The senior Dr. Focker is a sex therapist and is introduced conducting a ""sensuality class"" for elderly couples. In the film's first scene, a male nurse starts to deliver a baby. A plastic breast is worn on numerous occasions by male characters to encourage a toddler to drink his mother's milk. An oversexed dog simulates sex with a cat, a doll, and anything else he can find.
","Non-stop risqu√© language, always for laughs. There are breast-feeding jokes, ""boob"" jokes, poop jokes, fart jokes, and jokes and conversations about vasectomies, virginity, masturbation, circumcisions, and more. Language includes multiple uses of ""s--t"" in various forms, plus ""ass,"" ""crap,"" ""hell,"" etc. A baby repeatedly says ""asshole"" (his first word). Some typical lines are: ""Is your vagina happy?"" ""I gave her a matinee today,"" and ""Does she climax regularly?""
","A few minor product placements: visuals of Sesame Street's Elmo, a mention of Underwood Ham, and a Starbuck's coffee sign in the background of one scene.
","Champagne, wine, and other alcoholic beverages are consumed during dinner and at some social events. A former CIA agent administers sodium pentathol (truth serum) to an unsuspecting victim.
","Parents need to know that in the pursuit of laughs, Meet the Fockers stretches the PG-13 rating in terms of subject matter and language. There are frequent, vivid discussions about and references to: sexual repression, sensuality, breast-feeding, circumcision, vasectomies, masturbation, and the sex act itself. However, other than some gentle kissing and embracing, the only actual sexual behavior on camera is a dog that simulates sex with anything that moves and even some things that don't. Language is coarse throughout, with mild swearing (""s--t,"" , ""asshole,"" ""crap,"" ""bastard""), toilet humor (literally and figuratively), and constant talk of body parts and bodily functions (breasts, farts, poop, breast-feeding, virginity, climax, and more). The family name -- Focker -- is the source of an unending volley of puns and innuendo. In addition, the comedy tries hard to be both politically incorrect and to exaggerate all manner of stereotypes (ethnic, occupational, gender-based); it succeeds in these efforts.

"There are many directly stated messages about taking sex lightly and treating women deceptively, but these are subverted by the consequences characters suffer later.
","Alfie is a charming rake who uses and mistreats women, but learns the error of his ways by movie's end.
","There are a few scenes where an unstable girlfriend of Alfie's drunkenly breaks glasses.
","Frequent sexual references and situations. Adultery, threesomes, offscreen abortions, and onscreen couplings between non-committed adults all make appearances. Nudity is surprisingly light, but there is one scene where a woman removes her top and struts around in panties while the audience sees her breasts. Women are ogled nearly nonstop by both Alfie and the camera.
","Some cursing: ""That's bulls--t!"" There are also lots of coarse jokes, such as when Alfie has problems getting an erection with a woman who sneers at him, ""Peewee.""
",,"Alfie and other characters smoke cigarettes and sometimes marijuana; many scenes show characters drinking and acting foolishly or making bad decisions and blaming it on the alcohol. Characters have illicit sex under the influence of alcohol.
","Parents need to know that Alfie is about a smooth operator who takes pride in using women sexually and then quickly discarding them. There are many, many scenes that are insulting to women and send negative messages about how to treat them. In addition to the messages about women, characters smoke, drink, and make awful decisions when drunk that they later blame on the alcohol. They also cheat on boyfriends and spouses, and one character gets pregnant and considers an abortion. There is some profanity, including one F-word and a few S-words; plus many coarse jokes. Sexual scenes are plentiful, though mostly discreet, though one scene includes a topless woman who walks around in underwear.

,,"Comic violence, character injured.
","Extremely explicit and graphic sexual references and situations.
","Very strong language.
",,"Constant drinking, smoking.
","Parents need to know that this movie is NOT for kids. It's filled with very mature material, including extremely explicit sexual references and situations (with nudity) and some violence. Characters drink (there is a distinction made between the appreciation of wine as a work of art and drinking to numb feelings or get drunk) and use very strong language.

"No real positive messages.
","The movie's heroes are thieves and liars who joke about not having any morals.
","Some action-movie violence. An exploding car. Some vehicle chase scenes.
",,"Occasional profanity. ""F--k,"" ""s--t,"" ""pissed."" ""Retarded"" used once. Two characters in a recording studio have their profanity comically bleeped out by the well-timed bleeps in the song they're recording.
",,"One of the thieves is never shown without a cigar in his mouth. Wine drinking, some drunkenness.
","Parents need to know that Ocean's 12 is a 2004 all-star heist movie in which a group of skilled thieves must pull off the heists of their lives in order to pay back a huge debt. There's some action-movie violence: an exploding car, vehicle chase scenes. Occasional profanity is heard, including ""f--k."" Two characters cursing in a recording studio have their curse words bleeped out by the well-timed bleeps of the song they are trying to record. One of the thieves is never shown without a cigar in his mouth. Some drinking occurs, including two scenes in which the characters act drunk.

"Though Henry starts out as a guy who lies to women he has one-night-stands with in order to keep himself unattached, he ends up being devoted to Lucy. In fact, he becomes so devoted that he helps her to overcome her disability. This is a comedy with some lewd and gross moments, as well as comedic portrayal of people with disabilities, but there is heart that beats beneath the surface.
","Henry definitely starts out as the poster boy for bad behavior, but he shapes up into a stand-up guy by the end of the movie. Lucy is a model of compassionate and kind behavior. Henry does use knowledge of Lucy's soft side to his advantage, but she knows how to stand up for herself -- she even protects herself by wielding sports equipment when she needs to.
","Slapstick violence includes a character being beaten with a baseball bat by a woman (but he's not injured). Lucy is in a car accident and suffers from memory loss, which is a sadness that affects her family daily. A mention that Lucy's mother is deceased.
","From the start, we learn that Henry dates and has sex with many women. References to these escapades include comments like, ""He pounded me like a mallard duck."" Though crude references and gestures are made, there are no naked images. Some kissing and feeling up.
","Offhanded cursing, though pretty frequent: ""s--t,"" ""t-ty dance,"" ""ass,"" ""asshole,"" ""balls,"" ""bastard,"" ""bitch,"" ""boob,"" ""booty,"" ""butt,"" ""damn,"" ""dammit,"" ""Goddammit,"" ""hell,"" ""jerk,"" ""piss,"" ""pissed,"" ""crap,"" ""slut,"" ""nympho."" Rude gestures like the middle finger show up a number of times too.
","Reese's Peanut Butter Cups and Spam get a strong send-up.
","Numerous references to smoking weed, including a scene where Ula is smoking pot and one where he is eating a pot brownie and feeding it to a dolphin. Characters drink beers or hard alcohol in almost every night-time scene. A woman drinks so that she will lose her inhibitions and have sex with Henry (he stops her). Lucy's brother admits to taking steroids.
","Parents need to know that some of the male characters in this movie don't treat women with respect. They lie to get into bed with women, and talk badly about their wives. True to form, there are numerous sexual references along with some lewd language. But the leading bad- boy in the movie does an about-face by becoming a loving, devoted boyfriend to a woman with a disability.

"The show plays up many of the typical soap opera characteristics -- betrayal, dark secrets, revenge, manipulation -- but it does so with humor, bringing a light touch to what otherwise would be pure melodrama. Consequently, while no one viewing this show is going to take away positive lessons in behavior or relationship management, they also won't be weighed down with heavy drama. And, in the end, the show does center on strong friendships and family ties.
","Although the ladies clearly care about each other and their families, the way they behave -- manipulating each other, trading on their sex appeal, deceiving people they love -- doesn't exactly make them candiates for role model of the year. But they do have strong friendships and family relationships ... all of which are frequently tested but almost always stand up to even the hardest challenges.
","The show's narrator is a woman who killed herself in the series' very first episode. Other storylines have included murder, assault, fatal accidents, crashes, fights, gun threats/shots, arson, and more, but there's rarely blood.
","Lots of skimpy outfits and making out/foreplay; several scenes in which lovemaking is implied (but no sensitive body parts shown). One of the housewives was involved in an affair with a teenager; others have also strayed or been tempted to. One main character cleaned house wearing lingerie while being broadcast on the Web. Some teen sex (and consequent pregnancy).
","Mostly words like ""damn"" and ""hell"", with the occasional ""ass"" or ""bitch.""
","Regular but not obvious product placements from Buick, KFC, Halston, etc.
","The ladies frequently get together for wine and/or margaritas; most of them have gotten tipsy (or more) a few times over the course of the show's run, and Bree has struggled with being an alcoholic. Also some teen drinking and drug use. One character was addicted to her kids' medication for awhile.
","Parents need to know that this tongue-in-cheek soap opera's focus on adult characters and situations makes it inappropriate for young kids and teens. Characters (adults and teens alike) have had affairs, covered up crimes, been addicted to drugs and alcohol, lied, and manipulated other characters in just about every imaginable way. There are plenty of sexy scenes (though no actual nudity) and banter, as well as over-the-top storylines involving violence and betrayal. Although older teens and adults will understand that many of the storylines are presented in a humorous way, younger children may not be able to differentiate between parody and drama -- yet another reason to make this one adults-only.",Desperate Housewives TV Review 
"Lots of bathroom humor.
",,"Comic violence, some macabre.
","Some crude sexual humor.
","Brief strong language.
",,"Characters drink; one goes to a bar to get drunk after being fired.
","Parents need to know that this movie has crude and macabre humor. In addition to the movie's feces-centered theme, the carcass of a dead horse and an arrow shot into a man's back are intended to be funny. A husband and wife tussle is mistakenly seen as sexual. Characters drink and one goes to a bar to get drunk as a way to respond to stress. There is brief strong language.

,,"Comic violence includes a ball hit into the pitcher's crotch, threats.
","Explicit sexual references, non-explicit sexual situations.
","Strong language for a PG-13.
","Viagra and other products mentioned by name.
","Drinking, scenes in bar.
","Parents need to know that this movie has strong language for a PG-13, with a wider range of bad words than normally occur in movies of this kind. There are a series of jokes about the inability of a Japanese ballplayer to curse correctly. The movie has non-explicit sexual situations and explicit sexual references. Characters discuss what made sex with each other the best either of them had ever had and make Viagra jokes. There's a reference to an alcohol abuse problem, and there are many scenes in a bar. A strength of the movie is the portrayal of intelligent and capable African-American and female characters.

"Characters learn to overcome nihilism and meaningless to find the interconnectedness in all things.
","The characters in this quirky existentialist satire on the human condition and suburban sprawl don't emerge as being especially strong role models.
","Mild comic peril and some shoving. Two characters repeatedly hit each other in the face with a dodgeball. One character sets another's house on fire, almost leading to the death of one of the female lead characters.
","Two characters are shown having sex in a marsh. They are clothed but are in a sexual position. In a brief dream image, one of the male characters is shown with long blonde hair and female breasts, as one of the other male characters sucks on one of the breasts until milk comes out. A woman is in a bikini posing in a sexual manner as she promotes Huckabees. The frequency of sexual intercourse is discussed, as is masturbation.
","Frequent profanity throughout the film: ""f--k,"" ""motherf---ker,"" ""c--ksucker,"" ""s--t,"" ""bulls--t,"" ""d--k,"" ""p--sy,"" and ""a--hole."" In the first scene, the lead character's first words are a torrent of curse words, and he repeats this torrent later in the film.
",,"Characters are shown drinking in a restaurant, but do not act intoxicated.
","Parents need to know that this movie has extremely strong language (""f--k,"" ""motherf---ker,"" ""c--ksucker,"" ""s--t,"" ""bulls--t,"" ""d--k,"" ""p--sy,"" ""a--hole""), and some sexual references (frequency of sexual intercourse is discussed, as is masturbation) and one brief explicit sexual situation (one of the male characters is shown with long blonde hair and female breasts, as one of the other male characters sucks on one of the breasts until milk comes out).

"Themes of trust and loyalty sincerely and ironically explored.
","While not a role model by any stretch, Shaun's character arc reveals him to be capable of making decisions, and he displays leadership qualities unrevealed before the zombie infestation.
","Graphic gore; cartoonish/over-the-top feel, but still really bloody. Humans and zombies constantly try to kill each other in various ways -- by biting, shooting, impaling, stabbing, etc. Zombie movie violence: entrails eating, flesh ripping, a character killed by having his chest ripped open by a horde of zombies.
","Some sexual references and crude humor concerning the lead character's mother.
","Frequent profanity. Regular use of ""f--k."" ""Motherf----r."" White character calls his other white friends ""n---az"" in an ironic greeting. ""C--t,"" ""c--k,"" ""pr--k,"" ""twat,"" ""hell,"" ""pisshead."" 
","Product placement for Coke and Jaguar.
","Characters often drink beer and cocktails and smoke cigarettes, spending much of their time in a pub. One of the characters is a drug dealer.
","Parents need to know that Shaun of the Dead is a horror comedy in which a London slacker (Simon Pegg) and his friends must fight for survival during a zombie outbreak. Although it's more of a comedy than a true horror movie, there's still enough blood, guts, and gore to turn your stomach and make you avert your eyes -- most of it occurring during the climactic battles at the end. It's also extremely violent. Zombies and humans try to kill each other in every way possible: biting, shooting, stabbing, impaling, etc. There's almost nonstop profanity -- regular use of ""f--k"" and variations, and a white character ironically calls his white friends ""n---az"" by way of greeting.  There's some crude humor: flatulence, sexual humor. There's also a lot of smoking and drinking, and there are a few drug references. There are also some intense scenes, such as when a son is forced to kill his zombie mother and some characters consider killing themselves.
