","Parents need to know that although The Net was released in 1995, its message about the dangers of the internet still feels relevant, especially for young teens who spend so much more time online than anyone did when the movie was released. (At that time there were only 23,000 websites compared to two billion today.) Years later, with the advent of broadband connections, the universality of online personal banking, and the known intervention by hackers and foreign governments in elections, the warning issued here seems prescient while also quaint and small-scale. A hired killer shoots people, sabotages a plane, and arranges for administration of a deadly medication. A couple is seen under a blanket, presumably after sexual relations.

"There's considerable lying, manipulating, spying, blackmail, and terrorizing. One man talks about raping a girl, saying, ""It was just statutory rape."" Another man refers to the only female lawyer in the firm as ""affirmative action on stilts.""
","A lot of off-screen violence: talk of two lawyers being killed on a boat that inexplicably explodes, talk of suicide and death. Some thugs repeatedly wound a man by shooting off a part of his ear and then grazing his shoulder before killing him on screen. Mitch kills one man by dropping heavy weights on him and beats another man to death.
","Mitch makes out with his wife, talks about cooking food naked, and has sex with another woman on a beach. Nothing graphic is shown other than some finger sucking and the unbuttoning of clothes. Avery flirts with and tries to seduce Abby.
","Considerable salty language, including ""son of a bitch,"" ""hell,"" ""f--k,"" ""motherf--ker,"" ""c--ksucker,"" and ""s--t.""

"While there's nothing conclusive, the movie dabbles in all kinds of mysteries that could possibly exist in the real world, from the mystery of pi (is there a pattern?) to the stock market, to the Torah, to other mathematical equations and to the idea of patterns in nature (spirals). Plenty for thoughtful minds to ponder.

","Parents need to know that Pi is an independent sci-fi movie, the impressive feature debut of Darren Aronofsky. It's filled with brilliant ideas, but shot in a very grainy, bleached-out black-and-white, with shocking, intense images that, at times, make it almost like a horror movie. It's already a deserving cult classic, but it's not recommended for viewers under 16. It includes scary, loud noises, a bleeding nose, dripping blood, and nightmarish imagery, like brains. A gun is shown, and there's some fighting, arguing, and chasing. Language is strong, with uses of ""f--k,"" ""s--t,"" and other words. A couple can be heard having sex through the apartment walls, with some sex-related dialogue audible. The main character takes pills for his screeching headaches, and is said to have tried marijuana and other things to combat his malady.

All other characters seem to have ulterior motives, and, seen through Max's paranoid eyes, can't be trusted.
